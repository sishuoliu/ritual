【SPEAKER 1 SCRIPT】(~700 words, 5 minutes)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today our group will present Michael Walsh's 2007 article "The Economics of Salvation" published in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion. But we won't just introduce this paper—we'll situate it within decades of scholarly debate, showing you the core questions and different schools of thought in this field.

Let me begin with the central academic debate: Is merit a "gift" or an "exchange"?

This question sounds simple, but it has generated sustained discussion for decades. One camp, which we might call the "gift" school, argues that Buddhist dana is essentially selfless, should not expect reciprocity, and follows the original intent of Buddhist doctrine. Another camp, the "exchange" school, argues that regardless of what people say, actual donation practices always expect returns—whether social prestige in this life or blessings in the next.

French anthropologist Nicolas Sihlé, in his 2015 Religion Compass article, precisely captures this issue. He writes: "We need to argue for the analytical importance of the distinction between 'gifts' strictly speaking and patterns of transfers that are more akin to an exchange or transaction." This points to the crux of the matter: when devotees support monks, and monks provide ritual services and bestow merit, is this a "selfless gift" or a "service transaction"?

To understand this debate, we must return to the anthropological classic—Marcel Mauss's 1925 essay "The Gift." Mauss studied gift exchange worldwide, especially the potlatch rituals of North American indigenous peoples. He noted that potlatch consists of a festival where goods and services are exchanged, gifts are made and reciprocated with interest, with dominant ideas of rivalry and competition between tribes.

Mauss's core thesis: all gifts create reciprocal obligations. The obligation to give, the obligation to receive, the obligation to repay—this is the famous "triple obligation."

But here's the problem: does this theory apply to Buddhism? Sihlé cites Heim's 2004 research, noting that "the gift should not be reciprocated is a widely shared feature of South Asian theories of the religious gift." In other words, in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, true religious gifts precisely should not expect return—seemingly contradicting Mauss directly.

This is where Walsh intervenes. Walsh takes a clear position. He writes: "Merit was never awarded without an anticipated return." More pointedly: "Land was never 'given' to Ayuwang Monastery—land was 'exchanged' at Ayuwang Monastery for merit."

Note the verb choice: "give" implies selflessness, "exchange" implies reciprocity. Walsh's argument: regardless of what Buddhist doctrine says, regardless of how people describe their behavior, what actually occurs is exchange, not pure giving.

Now let me hand over to the second speaker.

【SPEAKER 1 DISCUSSION QUESTION】
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Open Discussion Question:

"Walsh argues merit exchange 'never' happens without anticipated return. But Buddhist doctrine does teach 'non-abiding giving'—giving without attachment to return. So the question is: if a Buddhist sincerely believes they're giving selflessly, but Walsh observes from outside that this is exchange, who is right? Should scholarly analysis respect actors' self-understanding, or can it reveal 'truths' actors aren't aware of?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

【SPEAKER 2 SCRIPT】(~700 words, 5 minutes)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Thank you to the first speaker. Now I'll discuss the scholarship on merit transfer, focusing on two classic articles: Gombrich's 1971 "Merit Transference in Sinhalese Buddhism" in History of Religions, and Holt's 1981 "Assisting the Dead by Venerating the Living" in Numen.

First, let's understand why "merit transfer" is academically significant. It involves a fundamental contradiction between Buddhist doctrine and practice.

According to orthodox Buddhist doctrine, each person is responsible for their own karma. The Buddha's solution to the problem of evil: one's suffering is due to former sin, well-being due to former goodness. Moreover, morality depends solely on intention—in Pali, "cetanā."

But here's the problem. Gombrich observed that in actual South Asian Buddhist practice, there exists what seems to contradict karma doctrine: "transference of merit"—transferring one's accumulated good karma to others, especially deceased relatives. This seems to violate the principle that each person is responsible for their own karma.

Gombrich uses an elegant metaphor: "one's good actions build up a kind of spiritual bank account from which one can make payments to others" (p.204). Merit becomes reified—a "substance" that can be stored, calculated, and transferred.

How is this contradiction reconciled? Gombrich's core argument: merit transfer results from ancient ritual practices being "reinterpreted" under new ideology. As he notes at the paper's opening: "In the history of religions, it is a commonplace that practices survive the advent of new ideologies and are then reinterpreted" (p.203).

He uses an example familiar to Western readers: Christmas trees and Easter eggs were originally pagan ritual elements, yet they survived from paganism to Christianity, and in many cases from Christianity to secularism.

Now let's turn to Holt's 1981 paper "Assisting the Dead by Venerating the Living." The title itself is insightful: to help dead relatives, the method is to venerate living monks—by supporting monks and transferring the resulting merit to the deceased.

Holt writes: "giving material amenities to the monastic community and merit to one's departed kin was evidence that the giver had cultivated a healthy mental disposition characterized by selflessness, compassion and charity" (p.1).

Crucially, Holt emphasizes the social dimension: "In exchange for receiving material amenities, the sheer presence of virtuous bhikkhus presented the laity with an opportunity to make merit" (p.2). This acknowledges the exchange nature of monastic-lay relations—though monks seem to only "receive" without "giving," monks actually "give" laity the opportunity to make merit through their presence and virtue.

This resonates with Walsh's argument.

【SPEAKER 2 DISCUSSION QUESTION】
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Open Discussion Question:

"Gombrich found that merit transfer is a 'reinterpretation' of ancient ritual practice. This raises a question: when religious practice contradicts official doctrine, how should we understand this? Has doctrine failed? Has practice 'betrayed' doctrine? Or is this tension itself the source of religious vitality?"

                              (Duration: 5 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

【SPEAKER 3 SCRIPT】(~700 words, 5 minutes)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Thank you to the second speaker. Now I'll introduce Katherine Bowie's 1998 American Anthropologist article "The Alchemy of Charity: Of Class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand." This paper examines merit practice from a class analysis perspective, providing an often-overlooked critical viewpoint.

Bowie challenges a traditional anthropological assumption at the paper's outset. She notes that scholars have typically made a "radical distinction between societies where gifts predominate and 'the class society, where private property and the commodity are the norm'" (p.469). In other words, gifts are assumed to matter only in "primitive" or "classless" societies.

But Bowie argues this assumption is wrong. She writes: "While no one would deny the centrality of gift giving in the political economy of egalitarian societies, scholars have ignored and even denied its significance in class-stratified societies" (p.469). Her paper corrects this bias.

Bowie's research is based on extensive fieldwork in Thailand's Chiang Mai Valley, interviewing over 500 elderly villagers across 400+ villages. The statistics are striking: in the 1970s, 34.9% of central plains rural households lived below the poverty line, 45.2% in the south, 63.6% in the north, and 74.7% in the northeast.

Her field findings are equally striking. Of 273 villages surveyed, only 9 villages—just 3.3%—had respondents claiming villagers were wholly "self-sufficient." In nearly half (48.7%) of villages, most households fell short of rice for at least two or three months each year.

In this context of class stratification, Bowie analyzes how merit practice operates. Her core argument: "cross-class, unidirectional forms of giving such as charity may be important in mediating the processes of hegemony and resistance in the sociopolitical constitution of complex societies" (p.469).

When a wealthy person donates lavishly to a temple, they gain two things: merit and social prestige. Merit is religious-level return—blessings in the next life; prestige is social-level return—status in this life. This donation actually legitimizes existing wealth disparity: the rich are rich because they accumulated merit in past lives; their donations now accumulate merit for future lives—a self-reinforcing cycle.

Bowie cites Bourdieu: although Bourdieu portrays gift giving in precapitalist societies as "an elementary form of domination," he suggests state-based societies have developed more indirect, impersonal mechanisms (p.469). Bowie's addition: even in modern class society, religious charity remains an important mechanism for maintaining class hegemony.

This resonates with Walsh's analysis.

【SPEAKER 3 DISCUSSION QUESTION】
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Open Discussion Question:

"Bowie's analysis suggests merit practice may 'legitimize class inequality.' But this raises a moral question: if a religious practice objectively produces effects that maintain inequality, while participants are unaware of this, how should we evaluate this practice? Is it a product of 'false consciousness'? Or does our critique itself carry unwarranted elitist bias?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

【SPEAKER 4 SCRIPT】(~700 words, 5 minutes)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Thank you to the third speaker. Now I'll introduce two 2015 articles from a Religion Compass special issue: Nicolas Sihlé's "Towards a Comparative Anthropology of the Buddhist Gift" and Bénédicte Brac de la Perrière's "Religious Donations, Ritual Offerings, and Humanitarian Aid."

Both papers represent the latest advances in Buddhist gift research, both attempting to reassess Mauss's classic theory's applicability in Buddhist contexts.

Sihlé opens by stating that the Maussian category of "the gift" needs conceptual clarification. He cites Testart and Florence Weber, arguing we need a typology of "transfer" forms.

We need to distinguish "gifts" strictly speaking from "patterns of transfers that are more akin to an exchange or transaction, such as the provision of ritual services and their remuneration" (p.352). When devotees support monks, and monks subsequently conduct ceremonies—is this a "gift" or "service transaction"?

More interestingly, Sihlé brings evidence from a Tibetan Buddhist society where "Buddhist gift-giving is only of minor importance and transactions centred on ritual services are much more central to laity-sangha relations" (p.352). This challenges a common assumption: that dana is equally important in all Buddhist societies.

Now let's turn to Brac de la Perrière's Burma study. She distinguishes three forms of giving in Burmese Buddhism: ahlu (religious donation)—giving to monks or temples; kadaw bwe (ritual offering)—offerings to spirits; ke hse yay (humanitarian aid)—secular charity.

Her key finding about religious donation: "serving rice" to monks during alms rounds "is in keeping with the definition of a free gift rather than involving reciprocity, although it is supposed to be rewarded by merit through an impersonal process" (p.386).

This is a subtle distinction: alms-giving is a "free gift" rather than "reciprocal exchange" because monks don't directly return anything to donors. But donors do receive merit as return—only this return is realized through an "impersonal process," not directly given by monks.

She further analyzes the social function: "The transaction occurring in religious donations then emerges as setting into motion a crucial social process, the enactment and reproduction of the difference in status between monastics and laypeople" (p.386).

The asymmetric giving relationship establishes monks' higher status—because in social exchange, being able to receive without needing to reciprocate typically signifies higher status.

【SPEAKER 4 DISCUSSION QUESTION】
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Open Discussion Question:

"Sihlé found that in some Tibetan societies, gift-giving is 'of minor importance' and ritual service transactions are more central. This differs from usual understandings of Buddhism. So the question is: when scholarly findings don't match a religious tradition's self-description, how should we handle this? Revise our understanding of that tradition, or consider that society an 'exception'?"

【SPEAKER 5 SCRIPT】(~700 words, 5 minutes)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Thank you to the previous speakers. As the final speaker, I'll synthesize our discussion, articulate Walsh's theoretical contributions, and discuss contemporary implications.

First, let me summarize how Walsh integrates prior research.

We've introduced many scholars today: Gombrich and Holt on merit transfer, Bowie's class analysis, Sihlé and Brac de la Perrière's comparative anthropology. Walsh's unique contribution lies in integrating these perspectives with Marx's commodity theory, Bourdieu's capital theory, and Derrida's gift philosophy into a coherent analytical framework.

Let me summarize Walsh's position in three core arguments.

First, merit is commodity, not gift. What characterizes commodities? They have use-value—merit brings blessings; exchange-value—merit can be traded for land, rituals, status; they're products of labor—monks' practice and prayer is labor producing merit. This is Marxian analysis.

Second, monasteries are sites of exchange, not just sites of practice. Monks and nuns as institutionalized bodies engage in various exchange activities to ensure institutional survival. This echoes Gernet's research on Chinese monastery economy.

Third, religious institutions' long-term survival depends on economic exchange. Without material foundation, no spiritual enterprise can endure. Walsh explicitly states: without merit exchange, Buddhism likely would not have survived.

Let me discuss contemporary implications.

Today in China, we observe many religious economic phenomena: temple admission fees and touristification; ceremonial charges and merit pricing; WeChat payment "merit donations"; religious real estate and urbanization; online "lamp offerings" and virtual merit.

These phenomena spark controversy. Some say this is the "corruption" of religious commercialization; others say it's religion's necessary "adaptation" to modern society. Walsh's framework offers a different perspective: if merit has always been commodity, if monasteries have always engaged in economic activity, then contemporary phenomena may not be "corruption" but the continuation of an ancient pattern under new conditions.

This doesn't mean we should abandon critiquing religious commercialization. But critique should be based on accurate historical understanding. If we naively believe past monasteries were purely spiritual sanctuaries, our critique of the present rests on a false comparison.

Finally, several methodological insights. First, interdisciplinary research is necessary—understanding religion requires combining anthropology, sociology, economics, philosophy. Second, case studies and theory-building should combine—one stele inscription can reveal an entire exchange system. Third, material analysis doesn't dissolve religious meaning—understanding religion's economic foundation isn't negating its spiritual value, but more completely understanding how religion operates as a social phenomenon.

Thank you for listening! Let's open for discussion.

【SPEAKER 5 DISCUSSION QUESTION】
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Open Discussion Question:

"We've discussed 'economics of salvation' today. Final question: if religion indeed has economic logic, if merit indeed is a commodity, what does this mean for your personal religious understanding? After learning these academic analyses, would you view religious donations differently? Or do you believe academic analysis and personal faith can remain entirely separate?"
