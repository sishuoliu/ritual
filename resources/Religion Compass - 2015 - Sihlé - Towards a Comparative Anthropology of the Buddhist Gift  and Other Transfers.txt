Introduction1
Letusstart with the (seemingly) obvious:the central importance ofthe gift in many,if not
probably most, Buddhist contexts. From a textual doctrinal perspective, the practice of the
gift(P./S.dāna)2appearsasthefirstintheclassicallistsof‘perfections’(P.pāramī,S.pāramitā)
that the adept needs to cultivate on the path towards liberation (Guruge & Bond 1998,
p. 80).3 The fact that the one who was to become Buddha Śākyamuni is said to have
perfectedthepracticeofgiving(astheprinceVessantara,whoultimatelygaveawayhisking-
dom and even his wife and children) during his last existence before being reborn as
Siddhārtha Gautama has been argued to imply a ‘definite causal relationship between dāna
and liberation’ (Heim 2004, p. 39). From a more sociologically informed perspective, the
pre-eminence of giving and in particular of giving to the monkhood, as the paradigmatic
way of accumulating merit, has been stressed in many anthropological accounts (see for
instanceSpiro1970,chapter4).Wemayalsonotethat,atamoregeneral,theoreticallevel,
these forms of Buddhist religious giving are marked, at the very least in doctrinal formula-
tions, by the somewhat striking absence of an obligation to reciprocate the gift—indeed, a
widelysharedfeatureofSouthAsiantheoriesofthereligiousgift(dāna)isthatthegiftshould
not be reciprocated (Heim 2004, p. 34; Ohnuma 2005, p. 105).

ThisbringsustoMarcelMauss…orsoonemightexpect.Iwouldactuallyarguethatthe
terms of the debate have somewhat shifted in recent years. This is not to suggest that the
importance of Mauss’s work on the gift is no longer indisputable. David Graeber remarks
in hisrecentrevisitingofMauss’swork thattheFrench anthropologist’s‘universallyrecog-
nized masterpiece[,] (…) his “Essai sur le don” (1925), (…) has generated more debate,
discussion,andideasthananyotherworkofanthropology’(Graeber2001,p.152).Within
thisever-wideningfield,aparticularstrandofdiscussionhasemergedin(bothanthropolog-
ical and more historical or text-centred) studies of the gift focusing on religious traditions
with Indic roots (Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism). This strand can be characterized as
focusing on one area of (at least apparent) tension between the Indic materials and one of
Mauss’s core theses, that of the universality of the obligation to reciprocate a gift.4 As we
wellknow,Mausshimselfwasawareofthistension,asistobeseeninafootnoteintheEssai
sur le don, in which he acknowledges that the Hindu legal treatises actually contradict that
(supposedly) general principle (Mauss 1925, p. 144)—a footnote repeatedly quoted in this
strand of literature. Recent critical advances in the literature on the gift make it possible,
however, to dispense with this seemingly inescapable reference to a certain footnote or to
the tension with an assumedly general feature. As we will see, Alain Testart and more
recently Florence Weber have forcefully argued that the Maussian category of ‘the gift’ is
in need of conceptual clarification: a typology of forms of ‘transfers’ (to use Testart’s term)
wouldhelp,andtheobligationtoreciprocateisinnowayasuniversalasMauss’sstatements
might seem to suggest—even within societies practising the potlatch and other institutions
studied in the Essai sur le don. A slight shift in general perspective is thus possible and will
inform the following discussion.
The aim of this introductory essay is threefold. First, I would like to propose a more refined

distinctionthatmanyBuddhistsactuallydonotmake,forreasonsthatneedtobeexamined.
The second aim is partly terminological too, but much closer to the analysis of the
ethnographic data. To what extent can we speak of ‘reciprocity’ in the case of actual
Buddhist gifts (e.g. alms or donations made outside of contexts in which monks are asked for
religiousservices)?Wewillseethatthetermhasbeenusedabundantlybyscholarsintheiranal-

this effect, I will be drawing into the discussion the rarely studied remuneration of ritual
services. After a brief examination of the anthropological accounts of some Thai(-Lao) and
Burmese cases, which on the whole tend to support the above-mentioned general
assumption, I will offer data on a strikingly different case: a Tibetan society of the Nepalese
Himalayas,inwhichBuddhistgift-givingisonlyofminorimportanceandtransactionscentred

AgreeingontheTerms:BuddhistGiftsandOtherTransfers
GIFTSANDOTHERTRANSFERS
Overthelasttwodecades,theterminologyinmattersofgiftandexchangeinMauss’sEssai
surledonhasbeensubjectedtocriticalexamination,inparticularbytheanthropologistAlain
Testart and the sociologist (with a strong ethnographic bent) Florence Weber.7 Although
theydonotseeeyetoeyeoneverything,theydoagreeontheneedtodistinguishbetween
a ‘gift’ and what Testart calls an ‘exchange’ or what F. Weber calls (using a slightly
broader term) a ‘transaction’: it is only in the case of the latter modalities that we find an
obligation(Testartspecifies:alegalobligation)toreciprocate(Testart2013,p.258;Weber
2007,pp.20–21).Forgifts,weoftenfindasenseofmoralobligationtoreciprocate,butthis
isnotthesamethingasanactuallegalobligation,Testartargues(2013,p.257).Withinthe
opposite polar category (‘exchanges’ or ‘transactions’), Testart and F. Weber also agree on
thenecessitytodistinguishbetweenmarketandnon-marketmodalities.Intheformercase,
thetransactioniscentredon(‘objectively’comparable)goodsandservices,independentlyof
interpersonal relations.8 In the latter case (often termed ‘ceremonial exchange’ in the
ethnographicliterature),thetransactioniscentredonandderivesitsmeaningfrominterper-
sonalrelations(Testart2001;Weber2000,p.88,2007,p.20).Finally,theterm‘transfer’is
arguably appropriate for referring more generally to any movement of goods from one
person to another (Testart 2007, pp. 23–24).9
Thedistinctionbetween‘gift’and‘(market)exchange’mayseematfirstglancetooverlap
somewhat with that between ‘gift’ and ‘commodity’, a duality combining Maussian and
Marxian inspiration which has generated substantial scholarly discussion (see for instance
Gregory1982;Carrier1991;Yan2005,pp.254–256).ForGregory,‘commodityexchange
establishes objective quantitative relationships between the objects transacted, while gift
exchange establishes personal qualitative relationships between the subjects transacting’
(Gregory 1982, p. 41). My contention is however that the impression of terminological
parallelism is mistaken and, most importantly, that the gift versus commodity duality is of
little use in the analysis of Buddhist gifts and other transfers. Whereas the remuneration
offered in return for religious services may correspond to more or less commoditized
relations, it would be perhaps overly romantic, and in any case incorrect, to imagine
that Buddhist gifts such as alms and donations denote the simple opposite of commodity
relations. As we will see, Buddhist alms-giving is often marked by a prescriptive avoid-
ance of personal relations and denial of exchange: we are far from the Maussian gift, in a
domain left uncharted by the gift versus commodity duality.10 My discussion will thus
proceed on the basis of a (tempered) acknowledgement of the greater usefulness of
Testart’s distinctions.
Withregardtothegiftperse,Testartproposesatypologyofforms,focusingontheplace
ofreciprocation,overaspectrumrangingfromaninherentabsencetoacentralaim(Testart
2007, chap. 6). For our purposes, two important subcategories that need to be mentioned
here are inherently non-reciprocal gifts, among which we find donations (pp. 165–169),
and gifts marked on the contrary by the donor’s self-interest, such as offerings, for instance
to a deity, in a spirit of do ut des (pp. 161–162).
I contend that Testart and F. Weber’s distinctions constitute a conceptually important
(and, I will argue, a culturally appropriate) basis for a rigorous examination of Buddhist

gift-giving and other practices implying the movement of goods. Thus, according to these
distinctions, alms given to Buddhist monastic recipients or donations of food and other
necessities in contexts devoid of a transactional pattern, or donations of money given for
the construction of religious buildings and the like, but also for instance the occasional
redistribution of some of these by monastic recipients, would all be classified analytically
asformsof ‘gifts’.Theterm‘gift’hasalreadybeen used(albeitsometimesforawiderrange
of transfers) by a number of scholars writing about Buddhist societies. In many scholarly
discussions of alms and donations, however, one also finds a terminology of exchange and
reciprocity—a terminology, I will argue, that is too vague and loose. Where we do find

TRANSACTIONS:RELIGIOUSSERVICESANDTHEIRREMUNERATION
Thingsbecomealittlecomplicatedwhenweconsiderreligiousservices—bothbecausethe
ethnographic data is not devoid of a certain characteristic ambiguity, as we will see, and
because the typologies suggested by Testart and F. Weber, with their strong emphasis on
goods, rather than goods and services (not to mention religious services, which are
never mentioned), seem slightly less helpful here. Let us proceed step by step.
Whenmonksorotherspecialistsareaskedtoprovideservices(e.g.reciteparitta11orother

contexts, as David Gellner remarks in the Newar case, people try much less to ‘avoid the
appearance of exchange’ (Gellner 1992, p. 124). That the notion of exchange need not be

stances(Testart2007,p.28).Here,inanycase,whenapatronsolicitsareligiousspecialist’s
services, there is arguably an implicit agreement on mutual obligation (a defining feature
of exchange): the specialist will provide the service, and the patron will provide for the
customary conditions (food, offerings, etc.) for a complete, felicitous event. Even if
Theravāda Buddhists insist on keeping the terminology of the gift (dāna or other), the
element of obligation means that analytically, we are no longer in the realm of the gift.
I thus suggest that we interpret these transactions as not being very different from what
TestartandF.Weberidentifyasthemarketmodalityofexchangesortransactionsor,morepre-
cisely,notverydifferentfromtheprovisionofspecialistservices,inreturnforwhichremuner-
ation (an appropriate amount of goods, whether in kind or in money) is expected.
‘Remuneration’—fromtheLatinremūneror/remūnerō(torepay,recompense,reward),itselffrom
mūnus(function,duty,butalsogift)(seeGlare1968,pp.1146,1614)—isperhapspreferableto
‘payment’, with its strong monetary overtones, especially in Theravāda contexts, where
prohibitions on monks handling money seem stricter. Interpersonal relations (crucial to non-
market exchanges such as the kula) are not necessary for these transactions to take place and

‘doubletruths’foundinthe‘economyofsymbolicexchanges’(Bourdieu1998,p.95);more
specifically, in the section on ‘The Laughter of Bishops’, he notes that religious enterprises
have ‘two truths: economic truth and religious truth, which denies the former’ (p. 114).
There are processes of ‘euphemization of the economic relationship’ (p. 114) at play in
religious language and transactions: in the religious domain, ‘objectively economic enter-
prises’ thrive on the basis of ‘the misrecognition of their economic dimension’ (pp. 118–119,
original emphasis).12 In a somewhat similar vein—but in a discussion pertaining to
non-market exchanges, such as those that take place between partners in various kinds of
friendshiprelations—Testartobservesthattheseexchangesareoftenphrasedintermsofgift
and counter-gift (Testart 2001, pp. 739–740). This gives rise to an ‘illusion’ (Testart 2001,
pp. 739–740). ‘[The disappearance of] the reality of exchange behind the fiction of a gift’
seems to give both donor and recipient ‘a larger role than the one they have’, the relations
of value between the terms of the exchange as well as the obligation of a return receding
out of sight (p. 742). Finally, is it not often the case that the religious service provided by
the specialist(preaching,teaching,conferring tantricinitiation oreven performing a thera-
peutic, protective or exorcistic ritual…) is considered of greater value than any goods that
the patron can offer? This too may well contribute to the transaction being rarely referred
to in terms of exchange or even reciprocity. Let us not overstate, however, the difference
in value between the religious service and the remuneration given in return; here, we also
have a situation of (generally well-recognized, even if rarely articulated) mutual dependence:
dependenceonspecialistservicesontheonehandanddependenceonsupportforone’slive-
lihood on the other.
It should however be recognized that some aspects of these transactions centred on the
provision of religious services do not fit in well with the characteristics of ‘market
exchanges’ as defined by Testart or F. Weber in their typologies. The importance, at least
in some contexts, of the moral state of the specialist for the efficacy of the services suggests
that these Buddhist transactions are slightly more complex than the simply services-and-
goods-centred nature of the market transactions usually designated by the categories of
‘provision of services’ and their ‘remuneration’. One can also note that the appropriate
amount of goods to be given in return for a certain type of religious service is not always
fixed according to a simple pattern of equivalence of value: the social identities of the par-
ticipants in the transaction may influence the exchange (which is described actually as a
feature of non-market exchanges). Thus, poor recipients of ritual services are often
allowedtoprovidemoremodestreturnsinabsoluteterms.Insomecontexts,ritualservices
provided to one’s close kin are not expected to be remunerated at all (apart from perhaps
serving the ritual specialist some drink or food). Here, Marshall Sahlins’s discussion of
variations in reciprocity in ‘primitive exchange’ (much of which bears relevance for other
societies also) may contain some useful insights. In exchanges (‘balanced reciprocity’,
Sahlins 1972, pp. 194–195) with poor members of communities, wealthier partners in
the exchange may feel ‘constraints on acquisitiveness (…) if not a certain richesse oblige’:
in effect, ‘differences in fortune between the exchange partners compel a more altruistic
(…) transaction thanis otherwiseappropriate’ (p. 211): something closer toSahlins’s category
of ‘generalized reciprocity’ (pp. 193–194). A similar shift is observed in cases of kinship
ties (p. 196).

Tibetanareas. If a communal ritual is perceived tobring benefits to the village sponsors, then
thisconstitutes a transactionsimilar tothosefound in the provision ofotherreligious services;
otherwise, these interactions correspond quite well to Testart’s third and final main category
(afterthegift,devoidofanylegalobligationtoreciprocate,andtheexchange),acategorywhich
he terms ‘transfers of the third type’, and which comprises taxes, corvée labour, fines and so
forth. These share the absence of obligation to reciprocate that we find in the gift, but they
arecompulsory,whichthegiftisnot(Testart2013,p.259).
PUTTINGTOTESTOURCATEGORIZATIONOFRELIGIOUSTRANSFERS:NOTESONTHETIBETANCASE
Before going any further, we should investigate whether these distinctions make sense
with regard to, and thus would effectively help in examining, Asian (or even other)
Buddhists’ own categories in such matters. The question is not whether indigenous
terminologies perfectly mirror this scheme of analytical categories (which is rather un-
likely, given that the former always tend to be messier than formal models), but whether
these categorical distinctions would be recognized as meaningful. I will offer a very brief
and partial examination of the case of Tibetan terminologies—the plural is necessary
here, given the extent of language variation in the Tibetan cultural area, as well as
the existence of both literary and vernacular forms. (The following will refer to collo-
quial central Tibetan unless otherwise specified.)
At a doctrinal, literary level, the practice of giving (in the sense of dāna in its Mahāyāna
Buddhist uses: alms, charity, donations…) is most commonly called jinpa [sbyin-pa].13
In colloquial Tibetan, however, a hierarchy of status also determines the vocabulary
(not to mention, depending on the status of the persons involved or addressed, the po-
lite use of honorific, ordinary and sometimes humilific registers, which may involve the
switching to verbs and nouns based on different roots). In this context, if we focus on
the most important terms in religious interactions, the noun jinpa refers more specifically
to giving to an equal or inferior, such as a poor mendicant monk or a beggar, while
bülwa [’bul-ba] is preferred as a general term (both as a noun and as a verb) for giving
to superiors, such as respected monks or masters.14 This last term is also one of the terms
used when goods or money are presented to religious specialists after they have per-
formed ritual services solicited by the patron; thus, the distinction between donation
and remuneration is not always visible in the choice of terms.
More specific and commonly used terms, however, do exist. On the one hand, with
regardtothe‘gift’inTestart’ssense,nosingletermcoversexactlyallformsofreligious‘gift’;
instead,wefindanumberofsubcategoriesorformsofgift.Thus,donations(forinstancefor
the upkeep or the construction of a temple) may be referred to as shendep [zhal-’debs] or
büldü [’bul-sdud] when collected by religious specialists,15 alms are referred to as sö-nyom
[bsod-snyoms], offerings (for instance to deities) are called chöpa [mchod-pa], and so forth.
On the other hand, remunerations for ritual services are actually often called yön [yon] or
its honorific variant kuyön [sku-yon], terms that would not be used outside such a transac-
tional context: here, the distinction with the donation clearly emerges.16 On the whole,
the distinction between ‘gifts’ (donations, alms…) presented to religious specialists and
remunerations for their services appears much more clearly in Tibetan categories than in
Theravāda contexts in which terms like dāna may be used indiscriminately. One may note
that both the donor of gifts and the donor of remunerations are commonly called jindak
[sbyin-bdag],‘masterofthegift’,incentralTibetan,buttheycanbedistinguishedinAmdo
Tibetan: the former is called jindak, and the latter often yöndak, or colloquially yomdak
[yon-bdag],‘masteroftheremuneration’.17Finally,therootchö,inthesenseofan‘offering’

In Tibetan understandings, what kind of transactions are remunerations for religious
services? Tendencies towards the euphemization or misrecognition of remunerations are no
doubt present. Beyond such tendencies, in effect, it appears that remunerations are perceived
asneither being the sameasgifts nor (at least in principle) belonging simply tothe domainof
common market relations—such a situation would be strongly condemned.19 The scholarly
literature here hesitates: some formulations reproduce the euphemistic tendencies in their
choice of terms, but, in striking contrast to the literature on Theravāda societies, many
authors do not shy away from a terminology strongly connoting market relations of paid
provision of services. Aziz’s description of the relations between the Dingri [Ding-ri] laity
and the officiants of their household rituals is maybe the most explicit in this regard (but,
for that matter, maybe slightly lacking in nuance?): religious specialists ‘secure work’ and
are ‘hired’, and ‘the best are rewarded by prestige and full employment’ (Aziz 1978,
pp.256–257).Inexchangefortheirservices,thesespecialistsare‘paid’—aseemingparticularity
oftheDingrisettingbeingthat(accordingtoAzizatleast)‘everyreligiousservicehasafixedfee’
(p. 257).20 There may be possibly a slight lackofnuanceinAziz’s consistent choice of a plain
labourmarketvocabulary,butsimilartermsaretobefoundhereandthereinanumberofother
accounts.21
Outsideobserversarenottheonlyonestogobeyondeuphemizationsofrelationsinvolving
ritual services and their remuneration. One of my more articulate Tibetan interlocutors
(an elderly layman from Western Tibet, with some modest ritual training and experience, a
man both pious and endowed with a healthy dose of critical distance) even glossed
the word yön (‘remuneration’) as follows: it’s like the price, rinpa [rin-pa], of an object,
he said; it’s like trade, tsong [tshong], or like a salary, yok-la [g.yog-gla]. He was smiling
broadly all the while: not only was he eschewing pious euphemizations, but, with yok-la
in particular (which refers more precisely to a servant’s salary), he was being openly
irreverent and challenging common codes of etiquette. His choice of terms, in any case,
unmistakably suggests a proximity with the domain of remuneration of services and
market exchange.
Finally, a domain that corresponds to (unilateral) religious obligations in terms of goods,
services (labour) or even bodies is also recognized and distinguished from the previous ones.
Communaldutieswithregardtoprovidinggoodsorlabourforcollectiveritualactivities,aswell
ascompulsoryformsofmonasticrecruitment,areallglossedastrel[khral]:‘taxes’orobligations.

the meditating monk becomes the model of non-reciprocity’ (Tambiah 1970, p. 68) has
often been recycled as a general truth regarding actual Theravāda monks, irrespective of
their religious profile.22 However, the opposite claim, namely that the laity’s gifts to the
Buddhist clergy are based on a scheme of reciprocity, has been made with equal insistence
by a number of other authors, while a few have attempted to reconcile both positions, at

I will therefore start with an attempt at clarification.
THEDIVERSEMODALITIESOFTHEBUDDHISTGIFT

the following discussion, to draw on data from a variety of Buddhist contexts without any
systematiccomparativestructure.Inordertomaintainasrigorousadiscussionaspossible,Iwill
systematically make explicit reference to the sources. For certain points, it seems that we can
observe a certain convergence of the data, whereas for others, I will point to distinctions that

ically opposed to the performance of ritual services with worldly ends (e.g. Jordt 2007 on
Burma; Cook 2010 on Thailand), or, at the other end of the spectrum, ‘prosperity
cults/religion’ and the like (e.g., on Thailand, Jackson 1999; Scott 2009; Pattana Kitiarsa
2012). All these are major components of contemporary Buddhism in urban and even wider
contexts. Taking theminto consideration wouldmaybe not substantiallyalter the main argu-
ments made in this paper but would surely complicate them. What follows should be seen as
a tentative discussion, which may hopefully lead to future, more satisfactory examinations of
theseissues,basedonmorecomprehensivesetsofempiricaldata.
In actual practice, lay–monk interactions involving gifts to monks or monasteries present a
wide range of modalities, from daily alms of food to gifts offered during temple visits, to the
sponsoring of a son’s ordination or gifts presented during important Buddhist calendrical
festivals, donations made at a religious fund-raising campaign or perhaps even (in a domain
marked more by immediate reciprocity) the presentation of goods or money to monks who
have been invited to perform rituals inside the layman’s house.23 The latter case will be
examined separately, but, to put things simply, it is not always easy to distinguish ‘gift’ and
‘exchange’practices.Thus,howarewetounderstandapiouslayperson’schoiceofpurchasing

practices due to their daily and public character. Through this particular modality of giving,
Buddhist monastic and lay actors cultivate culturally stipulated modes of Buddhist roles
(see for instance Kawanami 2013, p. 152). The numerous rules pertaining to alms rounds
that feature in the Vinaya texts might well be indicative of the importance this practice
hadinancientIndicBuddhism(Guruge&Bond1998,p.83).Thesymbolicpre-eminence

Another pre-eminent and highly valued modality of Buddhist gift-giving, in these same
Theravāda contexts, is the gift of robes and other goods at the celebrations (Thai Kathin,

Themodalitiesofgift-giving,strictlyspeaking,arediverse,asmentionedabove,butthey
do not necessarily occupy as large a section of the lay–monastic interactions as one might
assume from common formulations on the ‘centrality of the gift’ in Theravāda contexts—
at least, provided we understand (following Testart) the gift as devoid of obligation and
recognize,incontrasttothis,the elementofobligationpresentinanumberof interactions
in which Buddhist specialists provide religious services and the laity respond by presenting
goods to them. The latter domain of activity typically takes up a very substantial amount
of monks’ time (apart from a minority of scholar-monks or meditation virtuosi), be it in
Theravāda, Tibetan or other contexts.28 But let us now come to the issue of (non-)
reciprocity in the gift properly speaking.

AlargenumberofdescriptionsofBuddhistgiftpractices(inthestrictsenseoutlinedabove)
haveemphasizedtheabsenceofreciprocity:ontheseoccasions,transfersofgoodsarenotonly
unilateral but also marked by an absence of acknowledgement or gratitude in the monks’
demeanour.29 However, many scholarly interpretations of the system are phrased in terms of
exchangeandreciprocity—withquitedifferingrationales,whichshallnowbeexamined.
ARGUMENTSFORRECIPROCITYINTHEGIFT
A first set of considerations consists in(repeated, but perhaps not fully convincing) arguments
that identify reciprocity in the very structure of the standard Buddhist gift (alms, donations of
food,robes,moneyandsoforth).
Inanumberoftheseapproaches,‘reciprocity’isunderstoodforinstanceasderivingfromthe
(supposedly)activerole ofthe monastic recipientof thegift.Thus,according toMelfordSpiro,
the layman offers material support to the monk, ‘while the monk in turn provides the layman
with(…) merit’; thus,here we find‘a perfectlysymmetrical system, exemplifying the general
pattern of reciprocity and exchange which, as Mauss (1967) has shown, characterizes all gifts’
(Spiro1970,p.412,emphasisadded).Similarly,forBorup,inthe‘ritualgiftexchange’,‘monk
andlayagent(…)arebothgiversandreceivers’(Borup2008,p.171).Or,inDonaldSwearer’s
terms:‘Inreturn[forthelaydonor’sgifts],thevirtuouspowerofthesangha[themonasticcommu-
nity] engenders a spiritual reward of merit (puñña), thereby enhancing the donors’ balance of
kamma/karma’; the author mentions different forms of merit-making rituals, such as gifts of
food during the morning alms rounds, as well as gifts during Kathin celebrations, and adds:
‘the structureof reciprocal exchangeremains constant’ (Swearer2010[1995], p.19, emphasis
added; alsoquoted by Scott 2009, pp. 95–96). Along the samelines, and moreexplicitly still,
GuillaumeRozenbergarguesthat,intheprocessleadingtotheproductionofmerit,‘themonk
places his full moral authority and spiritual strength in the service of the lay person in return for
his/hersupport’(Rozenberg2004,p.499,emphasisadded).Yetneitherthemonksthemselves
northeir‘virtuouspower’or‘spiritualstrength’appearstobeunderstoodasgivingorproducing
merit,beitindoctrinalformulationsorinethnographicmaterials.30Itisthusdifficulttojustify
arguingforthepresenceofreciprocityonthesegrounds.
Inotherscholarlyformulations,‘reciprocity’isseentostemfromthefactthatdonorsexpect
toreceivesomeformofreturnfortheirgifts.Thus,inheressayontheBuddhistgift,afterhaving
commented at length on its non-reciprocal nature, Reiko Ohnuma states: ‘what I have been
referring to as an unreciprocated gift is not wholly unreciprocated’; shifting her stance, she
continues: ‘reciprocity is involved (…). The layperson who gives alms to a monk (…) desires
and expects a return in the form of karmic merit. (…) [E]veryone knows that giving has its
rewards’ (Ohnuma2005, p. 110,original emphasis). Othersourcesthat put forward this kind
of argument could be quoted. Several of them mention the ‘merit account books’ kept by
Burmese villagers (Spiro 1970, pp. 111–112). But self-interest and even the calculability of
karmicrewardsdonotamounttoreciprocity.Thereseemstobesomeconfusionherebetween
the notion of reciprocity, which strictly speaking characterizes a relationship between two
agents, and the fact that the Buddhist gift is generally not a ‘pure’ or disinterested gift—in
contexts marked by theories of karmic retribution, this concept would make relatively little
sense.31
A mixed approach to the issue of (non-)reciprocity, combining a more social structuralist
strand, has been attempted by Tambiah in the context of gift-giving to monks in a Thai-Lao
village.Wefirstencounterargumentsverysimilartothosealreadycritiquedabove.Atthelevel

reciprocalobligation’(Tambiah1970,p.213).Inpractice,however,onefindsan‘affirmationof
reciprocity’:thedonor‘expectstoaccumulatemerit(…);themonkinturn(…)confersmerit
on the donor’ (Tambiah 1970, p. 213). But Tambiah also points to a larger web of socio-
religious reciprocities, beyond purely ‘Buddhist’ logics: monks are supported by lay donors
but perform ritual roles of benefit to the laity;additionally, we find a scheme of intergenera-
tional reciprocity here, as monks are typically the pre-adult or young adult sons of the older
laysupporters(pp.143,212).Yetafurtherdimensionofreciprocitycanbeidentified,Tambiah
claims,inthefactthatanumberofmaleeldersarespecialistsofritesofpassageandotherrituals
thatarecrucialfortheyoungergenerationasawhole,butalsospecificallyformonks(p.259).
Theextentoftherelevanceofthegenerationalfactorinthisaccountofsocio-religiousreciproc-
ity has been questioned however (Burr 1978). Tambiah’s structuralist arguments also go well
beyondourinitialfocusonindividuallay–monasticgiftinteractionsandunfoldatamoreaggre-
gatelevelatwhich,asIwillarguehereafter,wecanspeakof‘reciprocity’onlyinamuchbroader
and somewhat vaguer sense. So we still have no convincing arguments to corroborate the
notion that individual acts of Buddhist gift-giving are characterized, strictly speaking, by
reciprocity.
Finally,anotablerecentattemptatinscribingtheBuddhistgiftanditsreturnswithinalogicof
reciprocityistobefoundinanarticlebyRozenberg(2004).Thegistofhisargumentisthatwe
needtodefine‘reciprocity’inawaythatiscongruentwithBuddhistrealities:‘astheveryactof
acceptingthegift’or,inotherterms,as‘theobligationtoworkasafieldofmerit’(p.513n.6).
Here,thequestionoftheactiveorpassivecharacterofthemonk’spositionisrecognizedasim-
portant, but the argument is slightly unclear in this respect. The monk’s passivity is argued to
constitute a form of activity: in particular in modalities like that of the alms round, the monk
actively offers himself as a recipient of gifts (p. 499). But this activity precedes the offering
of the gift: it cannot therefore be seen as a reciprocation of it. The (supposed) need for a
more specific, culturally appropriate definition of the term ‘reciprocity’ is also justified in a
somewhat circular fashion: if we were to accept the idea that the Buddhist donation is an
unreciprocated, ‘free’ gift, ‘the monk would be indebted to the lay donor as the implacable
rule of gift-giving hasit’(pp. 513–514,no.6).But the question of thecreationofdebtinthe
context of Buddhist gift interactions cannot be solved deductively by reference to an
assumedly general sociological law: it has to be examined as a question of careful empirical
enquiry.(For fairness’s sake,it should be noted that Rozenberg is by far not the onlyscholar,
in the wake of Mauss’s writings, to write about the principle of reciprocity as if it were ab-
solutely universal, as we can see for instance in Spiro’s words, quoted above.) In the end,
Rozenberg’s terminological suggestion is original but ultimately strikes one as moving away
fromtheaimofconstructingagenerallyapplicableanalyticalvocabulary,sincethesuggestionis
to substantially modify a major category of the social sciences for the particular case of Buddhist
gift-giving.
On the other hand, and maybe more importantly, Rozenberg raises a key question: how
thenarewetoconceive,inarigorousway,ofreciprocityinthecaseoftheBuddhistgift?Here,
mostauthorshavesimplyoverlookedtheproblemofcalling‘reciprocity’(or‘exchange’,which,
strictly speaking, presupposes reciprocity) what is in fact an impersonal, mechanical process of
merit generation, devoid of an actual agent giving the merit. Thus, Juliane Schober (1989,

Iwouldsuggestthatwhatis‘circuitous’hereisprimarilythewayinwhichthisformulation
attemptstomaintainitspositionon‘reciprocalexchange’,evenifthesituationobviouslyrefuses
to fit into the common understanding of these terms. The solution, I argue, is that in our
descriptions of Buddhist gift-giving, we distance ourselves from the uncritically accepted idea
ofanecessary‘reciprocity’.
‘Reciprocity’suggestsavoluntaryinteractionbetweentwoagents(orlargerentitiescapa-
bleofaction),withtransfersofgoodsorservicesinbothdirections.InthewordsofSahlins,
‘Reciprocity is a between relation, the action and reaction of two parties’ (Sahlins 1972,
p.188).Inthepresentcase,aworthyrecipientofthegiftisneeded,butnoagentcanbesaid
toreciprocatethegift.Instead,wefindtheexpectationthattheactofgift-givinginitselfwill
generatepositivereturns,typicallyintheformofmerit,theincreaseofwhichwillcontribute
toafavourablerebirthorfutureworldlybenefitsforthedonor.32Thesereturnsarenotseen
as deriving from a recipient’s reciprocation (to the best of my knowledge, the available
ethnography fails to document this), but from the impersonal, mechanical effects of the
actofgivingitself.Thus,forinstance,intheNewarcase,‘dānisviewedmoreasanasymmet-
rical exchange—of blessing for gift—or as an investment with delayed returns, than as a
pure gift’ (Gellner 1992, p. 122): the recipient can make a small gesture of reciprocation
with blessings (the anumodanā verses, see below), but the process of merit generation (or
karmicretribution)isimpersonalandproducesdelayedaswellas(atleasttemporally)uncer-
tain returns.
Thus,weessentiallyhaveatwo-sided,(paceSpiro)highlyasymmetricalprocess:firstaninter-
personalgift,anactwhichthenautomaticallytriggersreturnsintheformofmeritandkarmic
retribution. Thislatterprocessis influenced by the religious qualitiesofthe recipient(in most
Buddhistunderstandings,theholiertherecipient,themoremeritisgenerated),butthisprocess
ofretributionisnotcarriedoutbyanagent,andthus,thereisnoreciprocityinanystrictsenseof
the word.33 This does not mean that acts of Buddhist giving cannot contribute to creating or
maintaining interpersonal relationships. Indeed, this is probably an important component of,
forinstance,Tibetanunderstandingsofthereligiousgift.34Thisishoweverasomewhatdiffer-
ent question, to which we shall return presently, but a thorough examination of which is
beyondthescopeofthispaper.Ithasalsooftenbeenpointedoutthatdonationsandsponsorship

heighten the donor’s social status, prestige or even power35; however, this of course does not

MINORELEMENTSOFRECIPROCITY:ALMS‐RECEIVINGVERSESANDOTHERBLESSINGS
Instrikingcontrasttothe oft-mentioned, seemingly normative non-acknowledgement of the
gift of alms by a monastic recipient, we also find instances in which alms or donations are
acknowledged by the recitation of verses, the choice of which may depend on circumstances
such as the nature of the goods donated. These verses, often described as ‘blessings’ in the
literature, aim at encouraging liberality and often consist in wishes of happiness, well-being,
protectionfrommisfortuneandthefulfilmentofthedonor’sdesires(seeforinstanceTambiah
1970, p. 208; Guruge & Bond 1998, p. 85; Gellner 1992, pp. 120–121, 185–188). The term
most commonly used to describe them is anumodanā (P./S.), which literally refers to an
expressionofthanksorrejoicing.36InNewarcontexts,onealsofindsthetermdānavākya(S.),
or‘gift-verses’(Gellner1992,pp.121,185).37

The ethnographic literature I have reviewed does not always clearly indicate in which
contexts the recitation of such alms-receiving verses is deemed appropriate, compulsory or
not. In some contexts, Newar Buddhist tantric priests are expected to recite these verses,
but younger priests in particular do not always know them (Gellner 1992, pp. 120–
121, 187). Hiroko Kawanami observes that Burmese thilashin (female renunciants without
propermonasticstatus)chantsuchversesinunisonduringtheiralmsrounds,whereasmonks
remain silent in such circumstances (Kawanami 2013, p. 102; confirmed in personal com-
municationwithB.BracdelaPerrière).AmongtheBurmesemonkhood,avoidanceof in-
teraction (be it through eye contact or through the recitation of blessings) with the alms
giversseemstobeparticularlyemphasizedinthemonastic-discipline-centredShweigyinor-
der(Schober1989,p.229).Thus,ethnographicevidenceisratherscantandpointsasmuch
to the absence as to the presence of this secondary feature.
InTibetanBuddhistcontexts,anotherformofreciprocationappearsinsomegiftinteractions

withthe higherlevels of the clergy—the Tibetancasewould needhere tobecomparedwith
examplesfromotherpartsoftheBuddhistworld.
Onthewholethough,thedominantthrust,asitemergesfromtheliterature,remainsthat

ANALYSISATAGGREGATELEVELS:‘WEAK’VERSUS‘STRONG’RECIPROCITY
Finally, it may also be useful to leave aside momentarily the level of a single two-person
interaction (or layperson–monastery interaction) and look at larger, more aggregate or
systemic levels, as a complementary perspective on these acts and relations.
Let us consider for instance the series of interactions between one layperson and one
monk;thisseriesmayincludeanumberof instancesofalms-givingbythelaydonor,aswell
as occasional sermons (typically in more collective settings) given by the monk. In such a
context, a number of authors are tempted to speak of ‘reciprocity’ or even ‘exchange’.
Taking our cue from Testart’s discussion of different levels of use of the term ‘exchange’,
ranging from the purely ‘kinetic’ (flows moving in both directions between two entities
orareas)tothefullest(economic)senseoftheterm,implyingintentionality,mutualobliga-
tion, mutual causality, etc. (Testart 2013, pp. 254–255), we may want to distinguish
between a weaker sense and a stronger sense of ‘reciprocity’. If a first gift is followed by a
secondgiftthatisofferedintentionallyasareturnbytheinitialrecipienttotheinitialdonor,
we may speak of reciprocity in the strong sense. In the case mentioned above of a monk

ter of systemic, structural exchange (Lévi-Strauss 1950, p. xxxviii). Bourdieu’s attention to
actors’ practices led him to point to important dimensions, such as the temporality within
which such acts unfold, that are missing in totalizing, mechanistic accounts such as
Lévi-Strauss’s; from this perspective, reciprocity appears as much less certain (Bourdieu
1980,p.167;seealsoOhnuma2005,p.118,aswellasTestart’sowncritiqueofBourdieu’s
position:Testart2007,pp.223–226).Whatthepresentsectionachieves,Ihope,istoshow
the important complementarity of various aggregate or systemic perspectives, even if the
point of departure of the present discussion is rooted—perhaps rather too strongly for the
anthropologist—in juridical norms (Testart’s approach), combined with a comparative
interest in the particular social universes of meanings, practices and institutions that inform
these acts.
A brief review of the gendered dimension of Buddhist gifts (yet another way to expand
beyonddiscreteactsofgiving)mayserveasausefulreminderthatpracticesarenotexclusively
determinedbynormsbutmayalsobestrategicallyemployedtocontestandredefinenorms—a
perspective that has somewhat been missing in our account so far. As we can see from
Kawanami’s ethnography of Burmese thilashin female renunciants, the subaltern, not-quite-
monasticstatusofthethilashincanbeseentoinduceawiderrangeofpossiblerelationalmodes
in interactions with the laity, including positions of obligation towards the lay donor. As
opposed to family members’ disinterested and non-obligating gifts, similar transfers of goods
bytotalstrangersmayoftencreateasenseofobligationtoreciprocatethroughservicesamong
thilashinrecipients(Kawanami2013,pp.134–136).Whetherthesetransfersareultimately‘gifts’
(in Testart’s sense) appears to be not only a question of juridical norm but also a matter of
contextandnegotiatedpractices.
If this thilashin example shows that the religious status of the actors partly determines
the nature of the relations of Buddhist giving, the converse is true as well: the ways in
which individual thilashin or sometimes their convents manage to strategically shape the
practices of collecting alms can be seen to influence the degree to which these thilashin
are perceived as monastic agents (Carbonnel 2009, pp. 272–274). For the similar Thai
mae chii, Monica Falk also argues that through the ritualized giving of alms to the mae
chii (of certain convents), these ‘mae chiis have actualised the potential of their ordained
position’ (Falk 2007, p. 146). Alms-giving interactions constitute the recipients as ‘fields
of merit’ and are experienced as implying heightened requirements in terms of proper
religious practice (p. 152).

Where we do find a central component of (‘strong’) reciprocity is in a very rarely studied
dimension of Buddhist lay–specialist interactions: the provision of religious services and their
remuneration. We will focus much more on this dimension in the following section, but for
thetimebeing,letusnotethatbringingtheseinteractionsintotheanalysismakesconsiderable
good sense when analysing what Strenski has called ‘generalized exchange’ or what we have
termed collective patterns of ‘weak’ reciprocity: after all, donations by the laity and freely
dispensed‘giftsofthedharma’bymonksarebutonepartofthemovementsofgoodsandservices
betweenthelaityandthesangha,andrestrictingtheanalysistothesegiftswouldbeultimately
ratherartificial.Thus,reformulatingStrenski’scomments,JoannaCookobservesthat‘theritual
servicesprovidedbymonasticsandthedānagivenbylaityconstituteasystemofgeneralisedex-
change’ (Cook 2008, p. 13). The notion of remuneration of services is conspicuously absent
from this formulation—we will come back to this very shortly. However, one thing rings
true here and possibly may reflect somewhat indigenous discourses. The monks’ provision
ofritualservicesisnotsimplypartofanexchangeagainstgiftsorremuneration;theyarealso
explicitly understood to be part of a larger system of (collective) mutual obligation: for
monks, to respond to the laity’s religious needs, and for the laity, to take charge of the
sangha’s material (and recruitment) needs.
Thus, in Baragaon (also known as lower Mustang), a Tibetan society in the Nepalese
Himalayas about which I will have more to say shortly, one hears that the performance of
funeraryritualsinthevillagesassociatedwithagivenmonasteryisacollectiveobligation,shared
on a rotational basis by the monks of that monastery as a way of reciprocating the

gists have all too often42) to a romantic overemphasis on reciprocity: what these Baragaon
monastic actors also brush aside, in insisting on a pattern of reciprocation, is a pattern of
domination. In this Tibetan society, although many non-monastic Buddhist ritual specialists
(tantrists, or ngakpa) are present as well, the monastic clergy is entitled by customary law to a

CONCLUDINGON(NON‐)RECIPROCITY
Thepresentdiscussionof(non-)reciprocityintheBuddhistgifthasattemptedtoprovidesome
clarityinanareamarkedbysubstantialterminologicalandconceptualvagueness.Theresulting
picture is more complex than what a number of previous formulations suggested. Beyond
necessary nuances—such as the occasional presence of minor acts of reciprocity (alms-
receiving verses) or the necessity to also take into account larger aggregates of interactions (a
level at which one can argue for the presence of ‘weak’ reciprocity)—the dominant feature
of acts of Buddhist religious giving remains their non-reciprocal character (in the ‘strong’ sense
oftheterm).
This feature, found in various religious modalities of the gift, has given rise to some more
general propositions. A number of scholars have suggested thatwesee the non-reciprocity of
religious giving as indicative of the salvational dimension of these practices. Thus, Ames has
argued thatnon-reciprocal religious transactions (giving alms for instance) are associated with
the sacred, the salvational, with mental self-purification or merit or rebirth, while reciprocal
religious transactions (as in ritual dealings with worldly deities and spirits) are associated with
theprofane,withconsolation,withprotectionfromexternaldefilementsorevenwithamoral
actions(Ames1966,pp.37–38).Inhisinfluentialworkonthegift(examinedinthecontextof
ethicizedsalvationalreligions),JonathanParryhasmadereferencetothemainthrustofAmes’s
suggestions(associations withthe salvationalversus the profane)and hasfurtherelaboratedon
thistheme(Parry1986,pp.462,467–468).Ohnuma,referringtothislineofargument,com-
mentsonthe‘basictruismaboutthegift’thatwe(assumedly)havehere:theideathat‘while
theordinary,reciprocatedgiftstandsasamarkerofthepurelysocial,theunreciprocatedgift
often serves to signify the sacred, the salvational, or the soteriological’ (Ohnuma 2005,
pp. 106–107). I would just like to suggest that the empirical data complicates this neatly
drawn picture. Thus, tantric initiations (cases of the ‘gift of dharma’, with often a strongly
soteriological orientation), for instance in Tibetan contexts, are rarely performed without
some form of offering for the master who confers the initiation. Indeed, the history of the
spread of Buddhism to Tibet is replete with examples of masters agreeing to grant tantric
initiations only when offered considerable amounts of gold and other goods. These
prestations have a specific name, wang-yön [dbang-yon], or ‘initiation honorarium’. This
suggests that reciprocation can also appear in contexts strongly marked by a soteriological
dimension.
Interesting reflections on non-reciprocity are also to be found in the literature on Hindu
forms of ritual gifts called dāna (or Hindi dān). Thus, Parry suggests that the ‘moral perils’ of
the Hindu dāna (in particular in terms of the donor’s sins that may be transferred through it)
mightberelatedtothenon-reciprocityofthedānagift.Otherformsofgiftsthatdonotentail
a similar risk are typically ‘governed by an explicit ethic of reciprocity’ (Parry 1989, p. 73).
However,Parryalsoacknowledgesthatthisprincipleisnotanabsolutegeneralrule:
The bhiksha (or bhikh) given in alms to an ascetic (or beggar), and the chanda donated towards the
upkeepofamonastery,representexceptionstothisruleofreciprocity;butneitherofthemissaidto
contain the sins of the donor orplace him in jeopardy if the recipient of his charity misuses his gift
forsinfulpurposes(Parry1989,p.73).

Buddhist practices of gift giving’ (Heim 2004, p. 61). In this respect, we thus find significant
differencesbetweencentralBuddhistand(atleastcertaincontemporary,northIndian44)Hindu
modalities of religious giving. Despite the fact that both are known as dāna (and that Heim’s
study of medieval Hindu, Buddhist and Jain treatises on dāna seems to point to substantial
commonalities, at least in that literature), we should exert caution in the extent to which we
assumecontinuityorsemanticoverlapbetweenthesecategories.
By way of a last comment, we have seen that the literature on Buddhist forms of giving is
markedbysubstantialterminologicalvaguenesswith,forinstance,recurringconfusionbetween
reciprocity per se and the expectation of returns (typically in terms of merit) for acts of giving. I
wouldsuggestthatthisvaguenessisinparttheresultofanuncriticalacceptanceoftheideaof
the pervasiveness, if not universality, of a ‘norm of reciprocity’—a ‘norm’ which has found
powerful echoes in major works of the social sciences, from Mauss’s Essai sur le don to
Lévi-Strauss’s Structures élémentaires de la parenté, to name just two. Annette Weiner’s critique
(see above and endnote 42), among others (e.g. MacCormack 1976, p. 101, cited in Yan
2005, p. 251), has probably not been sufficiently heard among scholars of Buddhist societies,
but one may hope that this may be changing. In her study of medieval South Asian theories
ofthe gift,Heimarguesthatwefindtherean‘emphasisonesteemastheidealsocialbond’,a
disposition ‘predicated on human difference and asymmetry’ (Heim 2004, p. 54). Esteem or
reverenceis‘avirtuethatresistsalogicofexchange’,andtheseIndicculturalconstructionsre-
gardingthegift‘shouldtempersomeofthestrongerclaimsvoicedbyanthropologistsaboutthe
logic of the gift, the universality of reciprocity, and the axiomatic superiority of the donor’
(p. 144). Finally, Testart’s Critique du don and its analysis of the very diverse (reciprocal or
non-reciprocal)modalitiesofthegiftprovidesuswithahighlyserviceablebasis(oratleastama-
jorcontributiontowardssuchabasis)foranexaminationofthegiftthatisfreeoftheshacklesof

brief remark on terminology is in order. The formulations ‘lay–monastic relations’ and
‘laity–sangha relations’ are probably equivalent in most Buddhist contexts; however, they are
not in Tibetan areas, where we find a ‘twofold sangha’, gendün de nyi [dge-’dun sde gnyis],
consisting of a monastic clergy and a non-monastic clergy of tantrists—householder religious
specialists of tantric rituals, most commonly called ngakpa.46 Both categories may receive

AcomparativeanthropologyoftheBuddhistgift 371
In the case of Japanese Zen, what Borup describes analytically as ‘payments’ for religious
services is conveyed in indigenous discourse through the notion of ‘donations’ (Borup 2008,
pp.41,270).Theterminologicalissuehaspartlyeconomicdeterminations:‘despitetheirlexical
and cultural meanings as “donations” ( fuse, Skt. dana)’ (p. 42), presentations of money

monetarytransactions‘donationsisreallyamatterof(legitimate)financialspeculation’(p.42):
‘donations (as opposed to payments) are tax-exempted’ (p. 173). But Borup also calls upon
Bourdieu to fully understand what is at play here: the ‘set prices’ (for instance when monks
are invited to recite sutras in front of the domestic altar) ‘are termed and regarded as
donationsinordertohide[Bourdieu’s“misrecognition”]and“wrap”[ineuphemization]theritual
andsocialgamegoingonbeneaththeformalandsuperficialpractice’(pp.172–173).

The family priest of Newar Buddhists receives ‘mainly daksiṇā, on occasion dān’ (Gellner

˙
specialists which are not specifically dān’, is ‘considered to be a payment in return for ritual
services’(p.123).Thus,here,the‘reward’forritualservicesisclearlynot‘conceivedasagift’.
Asimilarperspectiveisalsoveryexplicitlypresentinsomeinstitutionalizedformsofpayment
for ritual services in Tibetan contexts, such as in the payment for the protection of the crops
from hail by a tantrist—typically, a fixed annual quantity of grain collected after the harvest
by the village houses, called ‘hail tax’, sertrel [ser-khral], or sometimes ‘hail salary/fee’, serla
[ser-gla](Bell1928,pp.43–44;Carrasco1959,p.49;Jest1975,p.350;Gombo1983,p.50).
Butthecontrastobservedbetweenexplicitrecognitionanddenialormisrecognitionofthe
exchange nature of the transaction is not simply a matter of different ‘vehicles’ of Buddhism
or national traditions: distinctions similar to that also probably operate within given national
traditions.IntheTibetancontext,Buddhistritualspecialistsofverymodestreligiousandsocial

ILL‐FITTINGMODELS
Besides the analytical challenge of going beyond the rather widespread emic misrecognition
ofremunerationforreligiousservices,anotherreasonfortherelativefailureofanthropologists
(or other scholars, for that matter) to account properly for these interactions is probably the
influenceof ill-adaptedtheoreticalmodels.Thus,inAmes’sconsciouslyDurkheimiananalysis
(Ames1966,p.37)ofSriLankanreligiousacts,non-reciprocalmodesofreligioustransactions
(giving alms, preaching sermons, etc.) combine to form ‘an integrated network’ that binds all
actors into one ‘Buddhist moral community’; these transactions are meritorious, whereas

(pp.32–33).Forreasonspossiblylinkedtothetheoreticalframeworkemployed,Ames’sanal-
ysis omits to take into account the more reciprocal modes of laity–monk interactions, where
monks (the core representatives of the ‘religious’ domain) are involved in more ‘magical’
activities: the ritual services provided by monks, such as chanting paritta, are not mentioned
once.
Ritual services provided by the monastic clergy are not entirely overlooked but are given
relativelyshortshriftinStrenski’sinfluentialexaminationofpatternsof lay–monasticrelations.
‘[T]hesanghaprovidespreachers,teachers,scholarsand,incertaincases,healers’(Strenski1983,
p.465):notethediminutiveplaceaccordedtothe(eveninTheravādaBuddhism)widespec-
trum of ritual services—funerary, prophylactic,protective and,yes, sometimes therapeutic,or
divinatory, etc.—performed by monks. Strenski’s account goes on: ‘however, (…) none of
these services is, strictly speaking, reciprocated cleanly to the laity for gifts given, but is an
obligation,tosomeextent,freelyassumed’bythemembersofthemonasticorder(p.465).This
visionofsequencesconsistingofgiftsfromlaydonorsfollowedby‘free’servicesprovidedbythe
sanghaaswellasStrenski’sdenialofreciprocityinthesecontextsareechoedbyOhnuma(2005,
p.107).Thesecomments,however,completelybypassandleaveunthoughtthepresentationof
goods (remuneration) following ritual services performed by monks, in a spirit that may well
include some sense of reciprocity. Taking his cue from Lévi-Strauss’s models of ‘restricted’
and especially ‘generalized exchange’, Strenski thenexaminesthe lay–monastic relationsfrom
the latter angle in particular (Strenski 1983, pp. 473 ff.). This might have been a promising
comprehensive approach; however, Strenski’s choice of focus is strongly inspired by the
emically and scholarly more salient category of merit. Furthermore, his attention is drawn to
the larger civilizational ideals rather than to the actual, seemingly ‘crasser’ dealings on the
ground(p.474).Asaresult,ritualsaimedatmoreworldlyendsandthetransactionstheyocca-
sionareneverreallyexamined.
Schober’s model of primary versus secondary exchange will only be mentioned briefly
here. It highlights important differences between lay–monastic transfers of goods, on the one
hand,and(initsmainmodality)thedistributionoffoodbyalaydonortohisorherclosesocial
environment on the occasion of a merit-making ritual, on the otherhand: the formerdo not
create obligation, while the latter does (Schober 1989, pp. 102–107). It does not, however,
enable one to distinguish between the different kinds of transfers between the laity and the
sangha,allofwhichareunderstood(ascommentedonalreadyabove)as‘exchanges’.
Perhaps one of the more productive (albeit unrecognized) points of departure is to be
found in Tambiah’s classic monograph of the Thai-Lao religious field, in which he
offers an analysis of ritual syntax across genres of ritual (‘the grammar of ritual
transactions’, Tambiah 1970, p. 346). Of particular interest to our discussion are the elements
he provides regarding the temporal/syntactic order of two core sequences: gift → blessings
and ritual service → remuneration.

much more are donated lavishly to the monks), whereas mortuary or house-blessing rites are
ritual services solicited by householders, a situation in which (often misrecognized, or at

It is striking that in other, for instance Tibetan, contexts we find very similar

of these temporal/syntactic sequences points to meaningful and enduring relational struc-
tures of the Buddhist world.

monks have turned the refusal of alms (‘turning around the alms-bowl’) into a mode of
socio-political protest (Jordt 2008; Kovan 2012).

(Bunnag 1973, p. 49), even if their primary aim is much more worldly and immediately
pragmatic.51
This large category of ceremonies (some of which are centrally about acquiring merit, but
manyothersnot)constitutes,inBunnag’sterms,‘thechiefbasisfor[lay–monastic]interaction’
(Bunnag 1973, p. 49; see also Schober 1989, p. 139).52 Compared to the daily alms rounds,

(Bunnag1973,p.62,citingWells1960,p.207).53
Of course, beyond the ngan tham bun category, we find yet further, very worldly (and
oftencontested)ritualservicesprovidedbycertainmonks,suchasdivination,healing,creating
protective objects, selling lucky lottery tickets and so forth (see here, for instance, McDaniel
2011orPattanaKitiarsa2012).InBurma,thediverserangeofesotericweikzacults,withtheir

THEBUDDHISTGIFTINAMINORMODE:ATIBETANCASE
Baragaon, or Lower Mustang, is a small, predominantly Tibetan-speaking society in the
Nepalese Himalayas. It lies on the Tibetan periphery, but it has been shaped by 900 years
of at least intermittent religious contact with Tibetan religious centres and lineages and
has experienced centuries of (at times perhaps weak) Tibetan Buddhist institutional pres-
ence. Its religious demographics are rather typical of Tibetan areas. The Muktināth valley
(almost 1500 inhabitants), the core of Baragaon’s more densely populated southern part,
hasfivemonasticcommunitiesandonevillage-and-templecommunityoftantristsforonly
six villages, amounting to a totalreligious population of roughly 10 percent of the valley’s
population.54Muchofwhatwillbedescribedhere,intermsofdominantreligiousorienta-
tions, would apply to other culturally Tibetan Himalayan societies, especially to those—in
effect, the majority of them—that lack the demographic concentrations and sizeable
economic surplus enabling them to support large monastic centres.55 It may also apply to
a large extent to economically comparable regions within Tibet (or even within the larger

from large monastic institutions and lack the presence of outstanding or highly revered
master figures, but the great paucity of data available for such regions precludes any larger
discussion.
In a nutshell, economic relations between the laity and Buddhist religious specialists qua
religiousspecialistsaremarkedherebythepredominanceofritualservicesandtheirremuner-
ation,andtherelativelyminorimportanceofformsofBuddhistgift-giving.56InBaragaon,asin
many other Tibetan contexts, monks, and even more so nuns, are only minimally (if at all)
supported by their institutions.57 Their families provide only modest annual (unreciprocated)
support to their monastic kin, and even less to other monastics. Alms are collected only once
ayearinthevillagesassociatedwithagivenmonastery(dailyalmsroundsarevirtuallyunknown

Whereas Spiro observed that the average Burmese monk’s ‘standard of living (…) [was]
surpassed only by that of the wealthiest laymen’ (Spiro 1970, p. 310), in many traditional
Tibetan societies, an average monk enjoyed a life free of the constant toil of manual labour

This was particularly the caseamong the scholar-monks atmonastic centresof learning, who

household rituals (Tsarong 1987, pp. 60, 80). These figures are probably not exceptional;
buttheycannotbegeneralizedtotheentirerangeofmonasticinstitutionsacrossTibetanso-
cieties.Forinstance,largecentresof learningmaycomprisesizeablecohortsofrituallymuch
less active scholar-monks, whereas smaller local monasteries are more geared towards the
provision of ritual services (Dreyfus 2003, p. 44). Monasteries of the post-Mao era in
Chinese-controlled areas of Tibet have also seen their economies undergo significant
changes (Dagyab 2009; Caple 2011).
InbringingthisbriefexaminationofaTibetancasetoaclose,itshouldagainbeemphasized
thattheminorimportanceofformsoftheBuddhistgift,ascomparedtointeractionscentringon

the patterns are probably more complex in situations of higher demographic and economic
concentrations, where larger, important monastic institutions are likely to be found. Thus,
high-ranking social elites often devote considerable amounts of wealth to donations to the
monasticclergyand institutions (seefor instanceYuthok 1990, p. 166). These donations may
largelybeabsorbedbyreligiouselites,butthelatteroftenplayanimportantroleintheredistri-
butionofthatwealth.However, these particularsocio-economic contexts bear the mark,just
like all other Tibetan communities, of one crucial feature of Tibetan tantric Buddhism: the
centralityofritual,theavailabilityofstrongritualpowerandtheexistenceofanextremelywide
spectrumofapplicationsofthistantricritualpower,rangingfromloftysoteriologicalgoalstothe
enhancementofworldlylifeandtothecontrolandevendestructionofallkindsofforcesand
(non-humanandhuman)beings.Thus,theprovisionofritualservicesandtheirremuneration
remain a key feature of Tibetan lay–specialist relations, far beyond simply societies similar to
Baragaon.Demographicandeconomicdeterminismsarepartialatbest.
Beyond purely religious characteristics, such as the tantric versus non-tantric nature of the

An examination of the more complex Tibetan patterns alluded to above is beyond the
scope of this paper; but we have achieved a first goal in identifying an important pattern
of lay–monastic relations that diverges to a substantial extent from the assumedly general
centralityoftheBuddhistgift.Intheprevioussubsection,wewerecarefultonotethateven
in mainstream Theravāda contexts, we should not neglect a component of ‘Buddhism of
power’ with worldly efficacy in lay–monastic relations; in Tibetan, tantrically empowered
contexts, this component often occupies centre stage.
ConcludingWords:TheMeritsofComparison
Thisessayhasmadeseveralkeyarguments.Withregardtocoreanalyticalcategories,Ihave
argued that Testart’s (and others’) critical examination and refining of the Maussian termi-
nology of ‘gift’ and ‘gift exchange’ should be taken very seriously. Although some caveats
have been offered (critical work which no doubt needs to be further pursued), the distinc-
tions proposed by Testart between ‘gift’ and ‘exchange’, between market and non-market
modalities of the latter and between a variety of forms of gifts on a spectrum ranging from

inherent absence of expectation of reciprocity (‘donations’) to pronounced self-interest
(‘offerings’ made in a spirit of do ut des) provide us with a highly serviceable set of tools
to examine forms of Buddhist giving and transacting. What has become known as the
‘Maussian gift’ as well as the distinction between ‘gift’ and ‘commodity’ (as developed for
instance in Gregory’s work) need not be abandoned but leave us strikingly ill-equipped to
understand major forms of Buddhist giving.
A second set of arguments concerns the category of reciprocity (in the context of
Buddhist giving), concerning which I have made the case that here also there is a need of
conceptual clarification. A number of positions of, or formulations by, previous scholars
inthe fieldhavebeencriticallyreviewed.Therecurringvaguenessoftheusesoftermslike
‘reciprocity’ or ‘exchange’ when discussing Buddhist forms of gifts, such as alms or other
donations, may well be due in part to an (among others, Maussian) intellectual heritage in
whichreciprocityhasbeenuncriticallyacceptedasuniversal.Thistendencyhasalreadybeen
stronglycritiquedinotherquarterswithinanthropology(withWeiner’sworkforinstance),
and quite convincingly too in Heim’s historical, textual study of medieval Indic Buddhist
gift theories. However, these insights are still to fully make their way into the study of
Buddhisteconomics.ItisnotthatreciprocityisabsentinBuddhistgift-giving,butitsocca-
sional(and,onthewhole,minor)presenceinactuallay–clergygiftinteractionsneedstobe
more rigorously and precisely identified in the data at hand. At more aggregate levels of
interactions and/or actors, I have argued that distinguishing between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’
forms of reciprocity may also introduce more clarity.
A final set of arguments bears on the assumed centrality of the gift in Buddhist lay–clergy
relations and (at least lay) Buddhist religiosity. A first key critical observation, I submit, has
consistedinpointingtoavirtualblindspotinacademicwritingsonBuddhistlay–clergyinter-
actions:thecategoryofremunerationforreligiousserviceshasbarelybeentoucheduponinthis
literature,inparticularinstudiesofTheravādacontexts—andhascertainlyuntilnownotbeen
drawn into any larger analytical discussion. One reason may well be that in many (in
particularTheravāda)Buddhistcontexts,theprovisionofacommensuraterewardforreligious
services received tends to be presented, euphemistically or by misrecognition, as a gift (e.g.
dāna).Yet,itisimportanttoanalysepreciselytheseemicemphasesorconflations.Asthisessay
hasargued,thelackofscholarlyattentiontotheremunerationofreligiousservices—which,asa
category,hasremainedlargelyinvisible,intheshadowofthegift,asitwere—hasalsostemmed,
inanumberofcases,fromtheapplicationofavarietyof ill-fitting(Durkheimian,structuralist
or other) models. Drawing this category into the analysis, however, enables us to question
andrefinereceivedunderstandingsofBuddhistreligiosity.Finally,acomparativeexamination

are most visible in contexts devoid of high Buddhist clergy or major religious centres, but

has achieved, however modestly, anything of more general value, I hope that, beyond its
contribution to the development and critique of certain anthropological categories and
claims, it has also reminded us of some of the merits of comparison—something which
may have been, more often than not, forgotten.

8 To be more precise, services constitute a dimension that appears somewhat inconsistently in Testart and F. Weber’s
writings (although they do appear in Mauss’s work: see Carrier 1991, p. 122). They are generally omitted in these
authors’definitions,whichfocusonlyongoods(inabroadsense,includingmoney);theyarepresent,however,insome

10 Onemightalsonotethatsomedonation-givingpractices(seeforinstancetherelationsbetweenChinesedonorsand
Tibetan masters or monks mentioned by Caple and Campergue in this issue) appear to have a distinctly instrumental
thrust, if not an outright market-exchange character, the donor expecting commensurate return in terms of financial
success, resolution of problems, access to the master and so forth. Thus, both remunerations for religious services and
donationsmayleantowardsthepoleof‘commoditized’transactions:thedualitybetweengiftandcommodityappearsof

12 Amoreradical(butreductionist)Marxistperspectivemightseethisprocessintermsofmystification(e.g.Bloch1977,
pp. 320 ff.). Alternatively, one might want to draw some inspiration from Bloch and Parry’s ideas on a duality of
‘transactional orders’, one more long term and ‘associated with the central precepts of morality’, the other more short
term and concerned with less-valued individual purposes (Bloch and Parry 1989, pp. 23 ff.). However, the argument
has a strong social functionalist thrust, as in a number of Bloch’s writings: the ‘higher good’ pursued by the more
highlyvaluedtransactional orderisidentifiedasthe reproduction of society—somethingthatcan hardly besaid ofthe
Buddhist meritorious gift, unless we recast it as ensuring the reproduction of a very partial and specific society: the
sangha.
