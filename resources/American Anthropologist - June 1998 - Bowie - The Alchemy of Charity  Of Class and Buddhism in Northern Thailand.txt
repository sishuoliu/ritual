observes, the food gathered by the monks on their early
morning rounds is "taken back to the temple to feed the
temple boys, beggars, and dogs that throng the wat"
(1955:114). Beggars are also an invisible part of many
temple festivals, generally appearing after the festivities
are over. Often coming considerable distances, some
sift through the offering trays outside the temple, sepa-
rating the candles and small coins from the offerings
(see Figure 2). After the monks have finished their meal,
the poor are invited to eat or allowed to take home the
surplus food offerings, especially the perishables. Dur-
ing the northern cycle oisalak celebrations (which oc-
curs toward the end of Lent before the new rice harvest
is ready, a time when many villagers are beginning to ex-
perience shortages), beggars often travel from temple
to temple (see Figure 3). The prevailing paradigm of
merit making has ignored the interaction between the
apparent otherworldliness of Buddhism and the this-

The language of begging intimates that the poor are
themselves making merit by allowing those who are bet-
ter off to part with material possessions and thus prac-
tice nonattachment, in much the same way as monks
have been described as a "field of merit" for donors.15
The most common phrase for begging is "khoo thaan
(to ask for gifts), thaan (from the Sanskrit danu~) also
referring to gifts given to monks. Beggars themselves
commonly used the phrase "baj hap thaan" (going to re-
ceive gifts), identical to the phrasing of monks. One
woman used the phrase "tu phraphae maetaa" (going as
a monk providing compassion), explaining she blessed
those giving her rice. Intriguingly, the Sankrit/Pali term
for monk, bhikku, translated literally, means "beggar"
(Swearer 1981:7, 77).

man's list is very similar (1960:183-184).'
Such rank orders illuminate central assumpt ions in
the prevailing paradigm of merit making. All villagers
are assumed to be equally capable of following the pre-
cepts, giving food to the monks, and even building tem-
ples, the only criteria differentiating donors is their indi-
vidual desire to make merit. Furthermore, these rank
orderings are based upon debatable ethical presupposi-
tions that privilege a single act such as temple building
over the sustained virtue required of a person who daily
follows Buddhist teachings.1" Major donors, if defined
by absolute material gifts, are only a tiny fraction of the
total village population.1 By emphasizing absolute
amount of material goods given and ignoring relative
ability to give, the existing paradigm privileges the rich
in this life and the next. Impoverished villagers are vir-
tually excluded.
Ranking temple building as the most virtuous forni
