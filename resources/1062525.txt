Kenneth K. S. Ch'en THE ROLE OF
BUDDHIST
MONASTERIES
IN T'ANG SOCIETY
When Buddhism was introduced into China around the beginning
of the Christian era, it was confronted with a civilization that was
opposed to many of its prevailing tenets and practices. Buddhism
looked upon life in this world as suffering; the Chinese regarded
earthly life as something to be enjoyed to the fullest, since this was
the only life that he had. Buddhism aimed at terminating the
continuous cycle of rebirths with its incumbent suffering to seek
the tranquillity and peace of nirvana; the way to accomplish this
was withdrawal from society to lead the religious life. The Chinese
aimed at fulfillment of his destiny by leading an active life to
achieve what the late Hu Shih once called the immortality of the
three W's (work, words, and worth).1 The Buddhist believed that
family life should be abandoned and celibacy regarded as the
highest virtue; the Chinese, on the other hand, regarded family
life as the backbone of Chinese society, therefore considering the
perpetuation of the family line to be the highest duty of every
Chinese. The Buddhist advocated that members of the monastic
community should be freed from the burdens of earning a living
and should subsist only on alms donated by the faithful; the
Chinese strongly held that every able-bodied male should till the

soil and every able-bodied female should weave. The Buddhist
contended that the community of monks enjoyed an extralegal
position, not subject to the jurisdiction of secular law; the Chinese
maintained there is no separation of church and state, that all
monks should obey the laws of the imperial state.
Faced with this kind of opposition, it was no wonder that the
newly introduced Indian religion experienced great difficulty in
gaining a foothold on Chinese soil. After some two centuries of
propagation, the foreign religion could claim only three known
centers, one in east China,2 one in south China,3 and one in north
China in the capital of Loyang.4 The number of monasteries could
be counted upon the fingers of one hand, converts were few, and
translations of texts meager. In a way, the religion survived the
first couple of centuries mainly because many Chinese considered
it as but another branch of Taoism.
With the downfall of the Han dynasty in A.D. 220, China entered
an era of division between north and south lasting three and a half
centuries, until the unification achieved by the Sui dynasty in 589.
This Sui was short-lived and was followed immediately by the
powerful and glorious T'ang dynasty, which lasted for three
centuries.
While the political fortunes of the Chinese were at a low ebb
during these centuries of disunity, the fate of Buddhism took a
sharp turn upward. It seems that the disunity and attendant tur-
moil were just the conditions needed for the religion to gain
adherence among the Chinese. There is not time here to discuss the
various factors contributing to this spread among the Chinese.
Suffice it to say that by the beginming of the T'ang, Buddhism had
gained converts from all groups in Chinese society, from the peas-
antry at the bottom, through the gentry and the educated, to the
members of the imperial family at the top. According to a T'ang
catalog of Buddhist sutras, the K'ai-yiuan-lu, at the end of the
Han dynasty in 220, there were 200 items in 292 chiian translated
into Chinese, whereas in 730 the number had risen to 2,278 items

History of Religions
in 7,046 chian.5 Monasteries were now to be found all over the
land, in the teeming population centers of the great cities, or in
remote sparsely settled areas, on the summits of famous mountains
far away from human habitation, or in luxuriantly shaded valleys
alongside rushing waterfalls. The fervent and passionate devotion
to the religion was expressed most concretely by the thousands of
Buddhist images carved on the cave walls in Tun-huang, Yiin-
kang, and Lung-men, and in the widespread popularity of the Pure
Land School, while the intellectual vigor of the religion was
exemplified by the development of such highly philosophical
schools as the T'ien-t'ai, Hua-yen, San-lun, and Wei-shih.
One of the main reasons why the religion was able to develop and
gain widespread following among the Chinese was its ability to
serve the needs of all elements of Chinese society. The institution
through which the religion carried out its various functions in
serving the people was, of course, the monastery, which served as
the center for the religious life of the monks and faithful laymen.
Besides the spiritual blessings which the monasteries dispensed to
all, each group in Chinese society was able to derive special bene-
fits from the presence of these Buddhist monasteries in their midst.
Far from being institutions separated and detached from the
activities of the mundane world, the Chinese monasteries played
active and multifaceted roles that touched the lives of a large
proportion of the Chinese during the T'ang dynasty. Let us now
turn our attention to these different roles of the Buddhist mon-
asteries.
At the outset, we shall limit ourselves by excluding from dis-
cussion certain functions of the monasteries. For instance, it is
self-evident that the monasteries were centers for the religious
training of novices initiated into the order. Again, all monasteries
provided opportunities for worship by the laity, burning incense,
reverencing images of the Buddhas, seeking aid and solace from
the bodhisattvas, etc. Furthermore, the monasteries were centers
of Buddhist thought. Famous teachers were associated with
certain monasteries, and students wishing to master a certain school
of philosophy would converge on them. All these may be called the
normal religious activities carried on in a Buddhist monastery, and
we see no need to stress them. What we would like to emphasize
are those functions which are to some extent unique with the
Chinese monasteries.

Monasteries in T'ang Society
First, monasteries were regarded as the spiritual arm of the
imperial government. Just as the imperial armies served as the
military arm to protect against internal rebellion and external
invasion, and the imperial bureaucracy as the political arm to
ensure the enforcement of law and order, so Buddhist monasteries
served as the spiritual arm-first, to promote the spiritual welfare
of the empire and the well-being of the emperor; and second, to
ensure that the protective influences of Buddhist deities would be
extended to the imperial family and empire. The Chinese world
consisted not only of the people and the objects that we see
around us, but also of spirits and unseen forces that are every-
where. Such unseen forces had to be propitiated in order that they
would not bring misfortunes and calamities to the people and the
ruling dynasty. To make sure that unseen forces were operating
for the dynasty's benefit, T'ang emperors prudently patronized
those religions, Taoism and Buddhism, whose deities claimed to
have the powers to protect the realm against the unseen evil
forces. They were taking out a kind of insurance policy to protect
against the unknown.
In the case of Buddhism, the instruments developed were the
national monastery,6 created by imperial edict and located all
over the empire, and palace chapels7 established by the ruling
family within the imperial precincts. The national monasteries
were accorded preeminent status in their respective communities;
they were inhabited by highly educated monks, the elite in the
monastic community; and they were supported by funds from the
imperial treasury. We might say that the monks in these national
monasteries were treated like members of the civil bureaucracy in
having all their needs supplied by the state; they had no need to
depend upon alms from ordinary laity for sustenance.
In these national monasteries were staged a number of cere-
monies which had nothing to do with Buddhism but which were
performed for the welfare of the imperial state. These ceremonies
included the celebration of the imperial birthday and the observ-
ance of memorial services in honor of deceased emperors. First-
hand accounts of these ceremonies are furnished by Ennin, a very
observant Japanese monk who traveled extensively in north
China during the years 838-47. The usual method of celebration

was to stage vegetarian feasts for the clerical community and the
civil and military dignitaries of a locality.
On the eighth day of the twelfth month, 838, Ennin recorded in
his diary that, this being a national memorial day, fifty strings of
cash were donated by the throne to the national monastery in
Yang-chou to prepare a vegetarian feast for 500 people. In the
ceremonies which began at 8:00 A.M., the minister of state and the
commanding general led the procession to worship the Buddha.
Those participating in the ceremonies burned incense, waved
pennants, and chanted psalms. After the ceremonies, everyone
partook of the vegetarian feast.8
When foreign invasions threatened the empire, the emperors
would call for assistance in repelling the invaders not only on the
military forces but also on the protective influences of Buddhist
deities. This was achieved through the recitation in the monasteries
or the palace chapels of a sutra entitled Jen-wang-ching [Sutra on
the benevolent kings].9 For this recitation, images of the Buddhas,
bodhisattvas, and arhats would be assembled and placed on elabo-
rately decorated high seats within the monasteries, accompanied
by an elaborate display of lamps, pennants, and flowers. If the
sutra were recited twice a day amidst such arrangements, then all
the protective spirits in the kingdom would assemble to defend the
empire against external aggression.10 We read in the Buddhist
chronicles, for instance, that in 765 the Tibetans crossed the borders
and threatened the capital. This prompted the emperor to order
the Jen-wang-ching distributed to the monasteries and recited
there. The emperor himself attended the meeting in the capital.
Within a short while, we are told, the invading Tibetans were
pacified."l
Another group of monasteries figured prominently in this role as
the spiritual arm of the empire; these were located on top of Mount
Wu-t'ai in north China and dedicated to the bodhisattva Mafijusri,
the bodhisattva of wisdom.12 According to Chinese Buddhists, this
bodhisattva had a habit of making periodic visits to those monas-
teries. Once he appeared in the form of a pregnant woman at a

vegetarian feast and asked for two shares of food, one for herself
and one for the unborn child within. The donor of the feast under-
standably refused to give her two shares, saying that the unborn
child was not there to eat its share. An argument followed, and the
pregnant woman then resumed her original shape as Mafijusri,
flying away in the air to the consternation of the assembly.
Because of this legend, we are told that thereafter participants in
the vegetarian feasts on Mount Wu-t'ai were given whatever they
requested.13 The monks in these monasteries were constantly
looking for signs that would indicate the appearance of Manijusri.
Such signs might be a pervading fragrance in the mountains, the
appearance of strange lights on dark nights, or the sight of a
colored cloud in the cloudless sky. Whenever such signs appeared,
they were immediately reported to the throne, for they were
regarded as auspicious omens boding well for the welfare and
prospects of the empire and the imperial family. It is not surprising,
therefore, to read in Ennin's diary that the imperial treasury
would make immense donations to these monasteries dedicated to
Mafijusri. In 840, for instance, we are told that the donations
consisted of 500 fine robes, 500 packages of silk floss, 1,000 pieces
of scarf, 1,000 ounces of incense, 1,000 catties of tea, and 1,000
hand towels.14 These gifts were part of the premium paid by the
empire to the Buddhist monasteries for the protection offered
against the unseen world.
Second, the monasteries were havens for the literati. In the
writings of many outstanding poets of the T'ang dynasty, we find
a constantly repeated theme, a longing to get away from the ills of
the world, to seek refuge in the serenity and tranquillity of a
Buddhist monastery. These poets, products of the rigorous system
of Confucian education, had capped their long and arduous years
of preparation by winning the highest degrees in the civil service
examinations and by being appointed to office in the imperial
bureaucracy. As such, these men were the pride of their family and
clan, for they were the elite of the empire. One would expect them
to bask in the glory of their exalted positions. Such was not the
case, however, with a considerable number of such literary figures.
These men knew only too well that their positions, status, and
prestige so often depended upon the fate of men at the top of the
power structure. If the chief ministers whom they supported
enjoyed imperial favor, their positions were secure; but this secu-

rity could be lost immediately if the chief ministers lost out in the
ceaseless power struggle at the top. To the literati, officialdom was
always fraught with risks and dangers; it is therefore not surprising
that so many literary figures expressed a yearning to escape from
the temporal struggles and to seek a peaceful haven in Buddhist
monasteries.
To these men, the Buddhist monastery offered ideal conditions
to pass away the time. Removed from the competition and rivalry
that entangled official life in the cities, they could roam about the
mountains or valleys where the monasteries were usually located,
sit beneath whispering pines and listen to the twitterings of birds,
wet their feet in the cool rushing waters of the mountain streams,
get lost in mountain paths shrouded in clouds, or just relax and
drink wine in the secluded monastery courtyard. Listen to the
sentiments expressed by one T'ang poet, Wang Wei (699-759):
Monk Chung-fan, Monk Chung-fan,
You left in autumn to go to Mount Fu-fu,
Now it is spring and you have not yet returned.
[You must be fascinated by] the bustling scene of falling
flowers and singing birds,
[You must be enjoying] the solitude, surrounded by brooks
and mountains just outside your door and window.
Surrounded by hills, who cares anything about the cares
of the world ?15
Another poem by the same author while staying at a monastery
goes as follows:
In this quiet valley one hears nothing but the gentle
sighing of pines,
In the recesses of the mountains there is no crying of birds.
When one opens the door, one sees the snow-covered mountains
clearly delineated.
The singing of the golden brook permeates the forest.16
And still another poem:
Not knowing the location of Hsiang-chi monastery,
I walk several li over cloud-covered peaks
And through forests of ancient trees never treaded by
human feet.
Whence come the peals of bells in the deep hills ?
The spring water gurgles as it is blocked by jutting rocks,
The sun shines, buit it is cool in the shade of the green pines.
In the evening, by the side of the quiet pool,
I sit in meditation, to drive away the poisonous dragon
[of disturbing thoughts].17

Monasteries in T'ang Society
Wang Wei had already attained the high post of prime minister
in the civil bureaucracy, but he was also a devout Buddhist who
called himself Mo-chieh, after the famous Buddhist layman
Vimalakirti (in Chinese, Wei Mo-chieh). After his wife died, he
refused to remarry, choosing to lead a celibate life to indicate his
devotion to Buddhism.
Another T'ang poet who extolled the joys of living in a monas-
tery was Meng Hao-jan (689-765):
Where he [the monk] lives is indeed most elegantly secluded,
And the people who live there have all attained tranquillity.
Dense groves of bamboo line both sides of the road,
The clear brook flows by the hut.
How free and relaxed is the monk,
Having abandoned all the worry and anxiety of the world.
The four meditations unite him with suchness,
So that he regards everything as illusory.18
The best example of a poet seeking haven and tranquillity in the
Buddhist monastery is that of Po Chii-i (772-846).19 During his
lifetime he held numerous posts in the government-imperial
censor, governor, president of the palace library, vice-president of
the board of punishments, etc. His official appointments took him
to different parts of China, the capitals Ch'ang-an and Loyang,
central China, and west China. Everywhere he went, he befriended
monks and stayed in monasteries.
In 815, Po was involved in a political assassination of the chief
minister in Ch'ang-an, and his enemies took advantage of this
situation to have him exiled to a minor post in Chiang-chou,
Kiangsi. This was a traumatic experience for Po. Whereas formerly
he was actively and closely identified with the affairs of state in
the capital, in touch with the leading statesmen of the empire, now
he was exiled to a region far from the center of political power.
Being powerless to exercise political influence, he decided to treat
his exile as a sort of semiretirement from the struggles of the
political arena.20 To this end, he began to write verses on things he
could enjoy the most in that area-mountains, waterfalls, land-
scapes, luxuriant vegetation, etc. Chiang-chou was admirably
suited for such a pastime, for nearby was the mountain Lu-shan,
already famous as the site of one of the best-known monasteries

in Buddhist history, the Monastery of the Eastern Grove, estab-
lished in the fourth century by Hui-yiian. So much congeniality
and community of interest did Po find here with the monks that
he decided to spend whatever time he could spare from his official
duties in their company. To this end, he built a simple grass hut
near the monastery, where he could live and enjoy the superb
scenery of Lu-shan to the utmost. In a letter sent in 817 to his
closest friend Yuan Chen, he wrote that after three years in
Chiang-chou, his mind was completely at ease, he was enjoying
good health, and the food in the area was excellent. He then
elaborated in great detail on the pleasures of living in his grass hut
next to the monastery. Here the clouds, water, rocks, and falls
were more beautiful than in any other part of the mountain. In
front of the hut were pine trees and tall bamboos. Whenever he
went there, he forgot about the rest of the world, wishing he could
remain the rest of his life.21
Many of the poems Po wrote during this period in Chiang-chou
described the joy and contentment he experienced living on Lu-
shan, and revealed some of the lessons he had learned from his
Buddhist friends.
In one piece he wrote:
The guest at Hsiin-yang is a layman,
His body is like the floating cloud, and his mind is like ashes.22
On another occasion, he plucked out a strand of hair from his
head and found that it was white. He immediately wrote to a
monk at Lu-shan:
Since I do not possess the powers of an immortal,
How can I escape this fate of old age and death ?
There is only the gateway to emancipation,
Which can carry one over this decrepit and painful peril.
I cover the mirror and gaze at the Monastery of the Eastern
Grove,
Subduing my mind, I thank the masters of meditation there.23
The last seventeen years of Po's life were spent in the eastern
capital of Loyang; while he still held official positions, these were
mainly sinecures with no duties involved. This afforded him all the
leisure he wanted, which he spent lolling in laziness, versifying, and
visiting monks in the Monastery of the Fragrant Mountain, a

setting which became the center of Po's attention and activities
during his declining years in Loyang.
First, he contributed funds for an extensive repair of the
monastery.24 Second, he put together a library of Buddhist scrip-
tures he had collected from other monasteries and presented it to
the monastery.25 Finally, he donated to the monastery all the
poems he had written since moving to Loyang.26 He called himself
the layman of the Monastery of the Fragrant Mountain, and in his
poetry he frequently alluded to his delightful sojourns there. In
one, he wrote: "The five sensual pleasures are dispelled, all worries

When I first arrived in Hsiang-shan, which became my home
in old age,
It was autumn, and the white moon was full.
From now on you are part of my home,
Let me ask whether you are aware of this or not.28
This life of leisure was shared in large measure with the monks
living in the monastery. He referred to these clerical friends in the
following poem:
A white haired old man, wearing purple robes,
I do not mix with the world but consort with the Tao.
Three times I have been assigned to Lo-yang on special
duty as an official,
Half of my friends are among the monks.
One must eventually withdraw from this wealth-conscious world,
Long have I yearned for my karmic friends of the incense.
After the vegetarian feasts, what can I offer you in return?
Only the springs, rocks, and the moist wind in the western
pavilion.29
We have referred to only two T'ang poets, Wang Wei and Po
Chii-i, but they are representative of the attitudes and activities
of those T'ang literary people who were attracted to Buddhism
and to life within the Buddhist monasteries. The anthology of
T'ang poems contains literally thousands of pieces which could be
used to illustrate our theme, but there is no need to belabor the
point further. We must proceed to stress another role which the
Buddhist monasteries played for the literati.

History of Religions
During the T'ang dynasty there was considerable traveling on
the part of scholars to the provincial and imperial capitals to take
part in the civil service examinations. While these scholars were on
the road, they very often spent the night in Buddhist monasteries.
And, after their arrival in the capital, they were also often put
up in the national monasteries while taking the examinations.
Scholars preparing for the examinations also found the Buddhist
monasteries, with their quiet and secluded surroundings, the ideal
place to concentrate on their studies.
So much for the role of the Buddhist monasteries in the literary
life of the Chinese. Let us turn to the economic role, where the
monasteries were deeply involved in such diversified activities as
owning land, operating industrial installations, and managing
financial transactions.
If we are to believe Confucian memorialists, the Buddhist monas-
teries were among the major landowners of the period.30 They
acquired their land through donations, purchases, mortgage fore-
closures, appropriations, and grants by the imperial state. And, by
arranging connections with officialdom or influential laymen, they
were often able to claim tax exemptions for their property. The
fact that monastic lands were typically tax-exempt led large
landowners to resort to subterfuge to get their own holdings regis-
tered as monastery land. One common method was for the land-
owner to establish his private burial ground and shrine within the
limits of a monastery, and thus to claim the monastery as his own.
This would be called his merit cloister, for, by donating his land to
this merit cloister or monastery, he could claim tax exemption for
it. Ostensibly, the land had been donated, but actually the merit
cloister was his own creation in the first place, and so the land
remained his private possession. In the eyes of the state, however,
the land was now monastic land.31 It is difficult to estimate just
how much land the monasteries possessed, for the figures concern-
ing the area confiscated during the persecution of Buddhism in 845
are not precise. One memorialist charged that the land in the
vicinity of the capital was largely in the hands of monasteries,
while another complained that monasteries controlled 70-80 per-
cent of the wealth of the empire.32 Such lands were cultivated by
temple slaves, tenant farmers, and novices and probationers in the
monastery. Out of income derived from these extensive holdings,

the Buddhist monasteries accumulated the capital to establish a
number of industrial and commercial enterprises which in turn
produced further income to augment the economic wealth of the
monastery.
Of the industrial installations, two shall be singled out, the
water-powered mill and the oil press. The former was one of the
most lucrative enterprises sponsored by Buddhist monasteries and
by rich families during the T'ang. The mills, used to remove husks
or to pulverize grains, were usually powered by water. Herein
arose the problem, for the water to operate the mills was also
needed by farmers for irrigation. This led to frequent controversies
between the mill owners and the peasants in the surrounding
areas, resulting in the government's restricting the use of water by
the mills only to certain months during the year.33
The monastery-owned mills were usually operated by lay
families called miller families, whose duty was to provide monks
in the monastery with the flour they needed. The grains from which
the flour was produced were obtained by the monastery through
donations, rentals from monastic land, or interest from loans.
Sometimes, the flour made by the miller exceeded the amount
needed by the monks for food, in which case the flour would be
sold by the monastery for a profit. Besides milling for the monas-
tery, the miller could also carry on private business during his
spare time, but he was obligated to pay a portion of his private
income to the monastery for the use of the mill. For the lay miller
as well as the monastery, the water-powered mill was therefore a
profitable industrial enterprise.34
The same may be said for the oil presses operated by the monas-
teries. Because so much oil was needed for the countless lamps in
the monastery and for cooking, it was an indispensable item; to
produce it, the monastery established oil presses which were also
operated by lay families. The arrangements between the lay oil
pressers and the monastery were similar to those in the case of the
millers. Hence we often read in the financial reports of the
monasteries, "Hempseed, two shih eight tou, delivered to the oil

Pelliot and now kept in the Bibliotheque nationale in Paris.

pp. 151-56. A selected list of important articles by Japanese and Chinese
scholars dealing with these mills may be found in K. Ch'en, Buddhism in China

pressers to be pressed into oil"; "Hempseed, four shih three tou,
delivered to the oil presser to be pressed into oil." 35
As for the commercial enterprises operated by the monasteries,
probably the best known is the Inexhaustible Treasury (wu-chin-
tsang). Previously we have mentioned the vast areas of monastic
land from which the monasteries derived considerable income.
Rich families who were devout followers of Buddhism, wishing to
accumulate meritorious karma to ensure a better rebirth in the
future, would make outright gifts to the monastery. The donations
made to the monastery for consumption by the monks would
sometimes exceed the amount needed by them, resulting in a
surplus of goods. These three items (income, gifts, and donations)
constituted the bulk of the capital owned by the Inexhaustible
Treasury in the monasteries. Why the term "inexhaustible"?
Because there was a continuous flow of wealth into the treasury
that could be used indefinitely and generate interest thereby.
With the capital that it held the treasury could make loans to
borrowers, charging interest at the prevailing T'ang rates, about
4-5 percent per month.36 Very often the borrowers would be peas-
ants living nearby the monastery who needed grains for seedlings
in the spring, and who promised to repay the amount with interest
in the fall. On occasion, the treasury would sell some of the goods,
the proceeds to be used for promoting the dharma.
Of these Inexhaustible Treasuries, the most famous was one
established in the Hua-tu Monastery in Ch'ang-an, concerning
which some fairly detailed descriptions exist. It enjoyed a history
of well over a century, during which the money, silk, and embroi-
dery stored in the treasury were, we are told, beyond calculation.
People from as far away as present-day Ssu-ch'uan, Kansu, and
Hopei went to the treasury to borrow; and regardless of the amount
borrowed or the interest charged, nothing was committed to
writing. The earnings of the treasury were divided into three
portions: one was used for repairs to the monasteries throughout
the empire; one, for the alleviation of the sufferings of the poor;
and one, for offerings to the Buddha. We are told also that the
faithful vied with one another in making their donations, bringing

their goods in cartloads, and departing without leaving their
names.37
Besides the Inexhaustible Treasuries, some monasteries and in-
dividual monks also indulged in financial transactions. In docu-
ments recovered from Tun-huang, numerous records exist of such
transactions. Loans were usually in the form of grains, cloth, silk,
and, in rare cases, money; contracts covering such loans were
drawn up between the two parties. In one contract, we read that a
certain Mr. Ts'ao, in need of some grains for seedlings, borrowed
about two shih of beans from monk Hai-ch'ing of the Ling-t'u
Monastery on the first day of the third month, with a promise to
pay on the thirteenth day of the eighth month. If he does not pay
by that time, the amount payable shall be doubled. Or, the
creditor may also seize his belongings to pay for the value of the
beans.38
While this contract contained no indication of the interest
charged, only the penalty for default, interest was unquestionably
charged. Some contracts found in Tun-huang contained the
phrase, "The interest shall be in accordance with rates prevalent
in the area,"39 while in other documents the rate of interest is
clearly indicated. For instance, one person borrowed two shih of
millet in the spring, returned three shih in the autumn.40 Another
borrowed seven shih of wheat in the spring, repaid ten and a half
shih in the autumn.41 In these instances, the interest rate was a
uniform 50 percent for half a year, a rate far beyond what was
allowed under T'ang regulations (i.e., 4-5 percent a month).
How extensive were such commercial loans carried out by the
monasteries ? Fortunately, we have some concrete data for one
monastery. It was the custom for accountants in monasteries to
present financial reports at the end of each year to the entire
congregation of monks in a monastery. The report for the Ching-
t'u Monastery in Tun-huang for 924 has been preserved; from this
document we learn that during that year, 366.9 shih of grains were
received by the monastery. Of this amount, revenue from temple
lands constituted 44.4 shih or 12 percent; interest income was 200
shih or 55 percent of the total; while donations amounted to 120

shih or 33 percent. For that one year, interest from loans repre-
sented more than half the income of the monastery.42 Loans in
money were rather rare, although instances have been found. In
one case, the individual borrowed 1,000 cash, promising to pay an
interest of 200 cash each month, an astronomical rate of 240 per-
cent per annum.43 One may conclude from this that it was far
more expensive to borrow money than goods from the monastery.
The foregoing discussion has provided us with some idea of the
extensive economic activities carried out by Buddhist monasteries
in T'ang China. These economic activities, and the wealth they
earned for the monasteries, were one of the chief factors behind
the widespread suppression of Buddhism ordered by Emperor Wu
in 845.44 That the motives were in large measure economic and not
religious may be noted in the nature of the suppression. Not all
Buddhist monasteries were destroyed; in each of the two capitals
four Buddhist monasteries were permitted, while in each of the
major prefectures one monastery was permitted. Those images of
the Buddha made of clay, wood, or stone were not to be destroyed,
presumably because they possessed no economic value. However,
ritual utensils and images made of bronze were to be converted
into coins; images of iron were to be converted into farming
implements; while images made of gold, silver, and jade were to
be confiscated and turned over to the bureau of revenue. All
monastic lands were to be appropriated by the government.45 All
this indicates that the state was primarily interested in confiscating
the enormous wealth held by Buddhist monasteries.
Let us turn next to the monastery's role as a center of religious
education for the masses of Chinese. Previously, we have noted the
widespread popularity of Buddhism among all classes of Chinese
society. Such popularity stemmed in large measure from the
program of religious education that the monasteries carried out to
reach the great masses of people. For the educated laity, the
problem of transmitting Buddhist teachings was not too difficult.
Such people could read the sutras themselves, or they could attend
sessions in the monasteries where masters of the law could preach
on their favorite scriptures. Occasionally, there would be debates
between these masters on intricate points of dharma; for those
laymen who were familiar with the controversial issues, such

debates could be very informative. Of greater concern to the
monasteries was the problem of reaching the large masses of
simple uneducated people living in the vicinity of the monasteries.
For these masses, the exposition and exegesis of a sutra would not
be suitable; the audience would not have the understanding or the
patience to sit through such formal presentations. What was
needed were some new approaches which would combine enter-
tainment with presentation of the rudiments of the religion.
Through the centuries, the monasteries evolved a number of
novel methods, and by the time of the T'ang dynasty these
methods were refined and utilized on an extensive scale.
First was the creation of a new type of preacher whom we shall
call by the general term popular lecturer. He might remain in a
monastery, or he might travel from place to place. For the
popular lecturer, four prerequisites were valued: voice, eloquence,
talent, and profundity. In other words, he must not only be
learned in the law, but he must also possess the voice and elo-
quence to be a sort of spellbinder, who could amuse the audience
and keep them awake with all kinds of stories, anecdotes, and
parables. Equipped with clever tongue and smooth language, these
popular lecturers were very successful in getting across the message
of the Buddha through amusing and entertaining stories.46
We are fortunate to have some contemporary accounts of one of
the most famous popular lecturers at work, Wen-hsii, who lived
during the early ninth century. He is described as an outstanding
individual, a monk of great virtue, proficient in chanting the
sutras, and possessing a soft pleasant voice which moved people.
Ignorant men and fascinated women delighted in listening to him;
they filled the monasteries whenever he spoke.47 However, a
Confucian critic charged that he discussed nothing but base and
vulgar subjects, and that true followers of the Buddha all ridiculed
him.48 This criticism provides good insight into the nature of the
audiences that attended the popular lectures. They consisted
mainly of the unlettered and rustic masses, who were delighted in
having the message of the Buddha embellished in the earthy and
robust vernacular so well understood by them.
These popular lectures were enlivened by a very important
literary innovation created by monks in the T'ang dynasty, the

pien-wen (or text of marvellous events). A pien-wen is a modified
version of a Buddhist sutra consisting of a mixture of prose and
poetry. The monks took a short episode in a sutra and expanded it
to tremendous lengths by adding all kinds of stories of marvellous
events. By so doing, they converted the sutra into an entertaining
vehicle for spreading the Buddha's message. As one example of
such expansion, a passage of fourteen characters in the Vimala-
kirti was increased to 630 characters in prose and sixty-five lines
of poetry, each line consisting of seven characters.
Probably the best known of these pien-wen is the Mu-lien pien-
wen, which recounts the adventures of the monk Mu-lien in search-
ing for his mother, who was reborn in the deepest Buddhist hell
because of her deceit and avariciousness. We can well visualize the
gripping interest with which the audience would follow a master
storyteller describing Mu-lien rescuing his mother from hell only
to have her reborn as a hungry ghost, then as a black dog, and
finally as a deity in heaven.49
The second method by which the monasteries reached the masses
was via the numerous festivals throughout the calendar year.
Such celebrations were the expression of deep religious fervor
by the Chinese; the intensity of this fervor was a good indi-
cation of the degree of acceptance of the religion by the
Chinese as a whole. In celebrating the festivals collectively, the
Chinese of the T'ang dynasty were drawn together in unity
through a common faith engendered by the Mahayana emphasis
on compassion and universal salvation.
The first popular festival in the Buddhist calendar was the
lantern festival, celebrated on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and six-
teenth days of the first month of the year.50 Ordinarily, the gates
connecting the different wards in the capital of Ch'ang-an were
closed during the night, thus restricting travel from one ward to
the other, but during the festival the gates remained open all night
and all restrictions were suspended.51 This permitted people to
wander from monastery to monastery, viewing the gorgeous
49 Many different versions of this pien-wen have been found in Tun-huang. I
have personally looked over Pelliot 2193, 2319, 3107, 3485, and 4988; Stein 2614
and 3704. Stein 2614 is published in Taisho 85. 1307a-14a. Numerous manuscripts
are also in the Peking Metropolitan Library; see Ch'en Yuan, Tun-huang chieh-yii-
lu (Peking, 1931), pp. 541 ff. For a discussion of this pien-wen, see Ch'en, Trans-
formation, pp. 24-28. There is an English resume in A. Waley, Ballads and Stories
from Tunhuang (London, 1960), pp. 216-35.

display of lights in each one. The Japanese monk Ennin described
a spoon and bamboo lamp which he witnessed in Yang-chou. It was
about seven or eight feet tall, with a thousand metal or clay spoons
tied to the ends of bamboo branches. Each spoon was filled with
oil and when lighted gave the effect of a gorgeous Christmas tree.52
Next on the calendar was the celebration of the Buddha's birth-
day- the eighth day of the fourth month-featured mainly by the
bathing and parading of the Buddha images.53 During some of the
birthday celebrations over the years there took place another
ceremony, that of welcoming and reverencing the relics of the
Buddha. When this happened, the emotional reaction of the
Chinese was indeed astounding. On the pretext that they were
making offerings to the relics, the Chinese would abandon their
occupations and exhaust their fortunes, or they would burn their
heads and cauterize their arms. In the celebration of 873, a soldier
cut off his left arm, and holding it in his hand he reverenced the
relic each time he took a step, his blood sprinkling the ground all
the while.54
The third important festival was All Souls' Feast, held on the
fifteenth day of the seventh month to commemorate the rescue by
Mu-lien of his mother from hell. It was believed that offerings
made to the Buddhist monks on this festival would result in merit-
orious rebirths for all ancestors extending seven generations back.
Because of this identification with the important Confucian virtue
of filial piety, the festival became most popular and widespread
during the T'ang era.55
On these festival days, when the monastery grounds would be
filled with visitors and spectators, the monastery would present
different kinds of programs that offered entertainment as well as
religious instruction. For instance, there would be dramatic per-
formances based on themes taken from the scriptures or from
episodes during the previous lives of the Buddha. There would be

storytelling by talented raconteurs and performances of magic
feats by monks proficient in such arts.56 Such feats undoubtedly
assisted in attracting attention and spreading the Buddha's
message; the Buddha himself once remarked that a magical feat
quickly captures the mind of worldlings.
Yet another method of propagating the religion was through
vegetarian feasts arranged by the monasteries throughout the
year. The occasions for such feasts might be the birthday of the
Buddha or the reigning emperor, the date of nirvana, memorial
days for deceased emperors or patriarchs, commemoration of the
completion of an image or a monastery, expression of gratitude for
some good fortune, boon, or benefit.57 To such feasts were invited
monks and laity on a basis of equality. The donors of such feasts
might be members of the imperial family, some rich laymen, or the
monks and monasteries themselves. Attendance varied from a
small company to the tens of thousands.58
Finally, the monasteries sought to popularize Buddhism through
organizing societies or clubs for laymen under the leadership of
monks. Such societies fulfilled a variety of purposes-constructing
images of Buddhist deities, copying or reciting sutras, preparing
for vegetarian feasts, or performing pious deeds for the accumula-
tion of merits. They varied in size, from a few to over 1,000
members, depending mainly on the purpose for which they were
organized.59 If the purpose was to carve an image of the Buddha
out of the walls of caves, then the number tended to be fairly
large. We have on record a Society for the Recitation of the Hua-
yen (Avatarmsaka [Garlands of flowers]) Sutra, which claimed to
have a membership of 100,000 and which met quarterly in sepa-
rate places, with each member reciting one chapter of the Hua-yen
Sutra.60
During the T'ang dynasty, such societies became rather common.
On certain occasions during the year, such as during the popular
lectures or the vegetarian feasts, the members of societies would

Monasteries in T'ang Society
offer their services to the monasteries. After the event, the monas-
teries would usually reward the members with a feast in which
there would be much merrymaking, eating, and drinking.61 It is
interesting to note here that, while Buddhism prohibited the
monastic community from drinking intoxicating liquor, the
Chinese Buddhist monastery made no attempt to discourage
devout laymen in these societies from drinking liquor.
Numerous documents have been recovered in Tun-huang con-
cerning these societies, most of which were notices announcing
meetings of the societies. The following is a typical example: "It is
requested that all members reading this circular will gather at the
entrance of the Tuan-yen Monastery at 6:00 A.M. on the fourth
day of the coming month for a vegetarian feast. The last two to
arrive will be fined one beaker of wine; while those who are absent
will be fined half a flask of wine. This circular is to be circulated
rapidly among the members, and no one is permitted to hinder its
circulation." 62
These societies afforded, therefore, the lay people in the vicinity
of a monastery opportunity to participate in the religious program
of the monastery. Through such activities as raising funds, assist-
ing the popular lectures, preparing vegetarian feasts, or copying
the sutras, they performed constructive deeds for the develop-
ment of the monastery. In turn, the society members gained
status in the community as well as spiritual instruction and benefit
from the clerical community.
Finally, there is the role of the monastery as a charitable insti-
tution. In a religion emphasizing the doctrine of karma, it would
not be strange if it were to take little interest in the sick, the
needy, and the unfortunate of society. For such people, after all,
are mainly reaping the rewards of their past karma, and one can
do little to help them. However, that same religion in its Mahayana
aspect also stresses compassion, altruism, and the unity of all life.
In line with this emphasis on compassion, the Buddhist monastery
in T'ang China carried out a program of charitable activities on
behalf of the unfortunate members of society. One of the instru-
ments to achieve this was the field of compassion. In India this
was no more than an abstract concept, but in China, with the
Chinese propensity for rendering the abstract into the concrete,
there were established actual fields of compassion connected with

the monasteries, which yielded income used for altruistic pur-
poses.63
Among the charitable institutions established by Buddhist
monasteries, we might mention hospitals and dispensaries to care
for the sick, the decrepit, and the needy. We have a decree issued
by authorities calling upon hospitals to gather beggars and feed
them.64 Orphanages, feeding stations for the hungry, and havens
for the aged were established, and burial services were provided
for those who were indigent and without relatives.65
These charitable activities were primarily for the benefit of
those less fortunate in life. It must be added that monasteries also
carried out projects for the public weal, such as building roads and
bridges, deepening river channels to facilitate navigation,66 digging
wells and planting trees on roadsides, or maintaining inns and
comfort stations for the welfare of pilgrims traveling to sacred
spots. To honor the public-spirited monks who promoted such
activities, a special section entitled "Section on Monks who In-
crease Merits" was set aside in the collections of biographies.67
It appears that the imperial government was cognizant of the
valuable contributions made by these fields of compassion. In 845,
when Buddhism was persecuted, a fear arose among the officials
that confiscation of monastic lands would jeopardize the social
welfare program supported by the fields of compassion. The
throne hastily approved a proposal advanced by one of the chief
ministers calling for a continuation of such fields of compassion,
with the proviso that they be administered by venerable trust-
worthy old men.68
This rapid survey has, we hope provided a glimpse of the varied
roles carried out by Buddhist monasteries in T'ang China. They
touched almost every group of Chinese society in one way or
another. For the dynasty and imperial family, the monastery with
its clerical community provided the avenue to seek for protective
influences bestowed by forces in the unseen world. For the literati,
the monastery afforded a haven of retreat and tranquillity in which
they could contemplate the ills of the world. For the rich families,
the monastery was a means to escape the onerous tax burden on

the land. For the masses of people, the monastery offered financial
assistance when needed, entertainment during the festivals to
lighten their toils, social companionship in the various clubs, and
a refuge in case of illness, poverty, or infirmity. To every Chinese,
high or low, it offered the spiritual message of Buddhism, that all
life is one, that our destinies are all interrelated and intertwined,
that we live according to the fruits of our acts, and that, if we are
devout enough, we shall eventually be reborn in the Western
Paradise.
