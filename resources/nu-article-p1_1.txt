ASSISTING THE DEAD BY VENERATING THE LIVING
Merit Transfer in the Early Buddhist Tradition
JOHN C. HOLT
Death is an inevitable fact of life. For the religious as well as for
some others, its occurrence does not necessarily imply life's ter-
mination or the final end of conscious being. In most traditional,
and even in some post-traditional cultures, death is regarded as a
transitional experience, a rite de passage: the deceased leaves behind
the familiar vicissitudes of human life and enters into a new modali-
ty of being beyond. Funeral rites, perhaps the oldest religious rites
known to human-kind, serve as a means to facilitate this transition.
In this article, it is not my intention to speculate upon the
metaphysical truth of this almost ubiquitous pattern of belief and
rite. Generally, I am more interested in determining how religious
interpretations of death valorize the human meaning of life. For
reflection upon the meaning of death is but another way of reflec-
ting upon the central significance of life. Specifically, I will focus
upon early Indian Buddhist conceptions of death: their cultural
origins, cosmological significance, philosophical rationale, and
social implications.
Buddhist interpretations of death did not originate in an
historical or cultural vacuum. Conceptions of the after-life, and the
prescribed behavior relating to the dead, were modified adaptations
of prevailing Brahmanical patterns of belief. This is especially
apparent when we examine the beliefs and practices of the early
Buddhist laity.
While Buddhist monks were intent upon gaining release from the
cyclical samsaric pattern of death and rebirth, the laity were
fundamentally concerned with performing meritorious actions in
this life that would improve their condition in the next. Eventually,
a lay person might embark upon the renunciatory monastic path
leading to nirvana. But until that step was taken, performing moral
acts of auspicious karmic efficacy provided the best assurance that

life after death need not be feared. According to this basic
Buddhistic understanding, one of the most meritorious acts that one
might perform consisted of giving gifts to the monastic community
and transferring the merit of that action to one's deceased kin.
Psychologically and philosophically, giving material amenities to
the monastic community and merit to one's departed kin was
evidence that the giver had cultivated a healthy mental disposition
characterized by selflessness, compassion and charity. Cosmologic-
ally, the giver not only increased the likelihood of better rebirth for
himself, but also provided an opportunity for deceased kin to share
in the karmic benefits of merit. The Petavatthu, a popular collection
of short sermons belatedly granted Pali canonical status, frequently
describes how one's suffering deceased kin are transferred to a more
blissful state by meritorious deeds performed on their behalf.
Socially, the effective material transactions involved in merit
transfer sustained the monastic community and fostered a
reciprocal relationship between the laity and the bhikkhusaligha. In
exchange for receiving material amenities, the sheer presence of
virtuous bhikkhus presented the laity with an opportunity to make
merit. In short, merit transfer was a practical and popular ex-
pression of Buddhist piety that was theoretically legitimate,
cosmologically potent, and socially redeeming.
From the perspective of the history of religions, this complex of
patterns associated with merit transfer also illustrates how the early
Buddhist tradition accommodated and transformed fundamental
Brahmanical conceptions concerned with the status of the dead and
the behavior of the living in relation to the deceased. Before the
appearance of Buddhist theories of karmic action, people of the
Brahmanical tradition systematically engaged in the performance
of rites designed to assist the dead in the nether world. The Bud-
dhist incorporation and rationalization of this Brahmanical pattern
reveals an emerging and uniquely Buddhistic conception of death
which in turn reflects a changing regard for the significance of life.
Buddhism has been frequently characterized by Western observers
as pre-eminently given to other-worldly pursuits on the basis of its
allegedly pessimistic view of this-worldly life. In the following
pages, I will contend that Buddhist transformations of Brahmanical
beliefs and rites concerning death portray a somewhat different pic-

ture : an increasing importance attached to this-worldly existence
and an optimistic ethical imperative to live the good life.
Death and After-Life in the Brahmanical Tradition
The early poets of Vedic tradition rarely speculated upon the fate
of the dead. Vedic religion recognized the finitude of human life,
but focussed almost exclusively upon maintaining favorable living
conditions in this world. Throughout the hymnodic samhitas and the
later ritualistic brahmanas, there exists no systematic or substantial
exposition of the nature of the after-life or of the obligations of the
living to the dead. Yet, pertinent passages in the funeral hymns of
the Rg and Atharva Vedas, when understood within the context of
ancient funeral rites still operative within Indian society today,
indicate a normative pattern of belief.
The most important passages that relate to the topic of this article
concern the conception of a class of beings known as pitaras (fathers,
ancestors). According to the Rg Veda, the recently deceased might
embark upon one of two paths: one that led to the realm of the devas
(gods) and one that led to the fathers' world. In a Rg Veda Soma
Pavama-na hymn, the pathway leading to the realm of the pitaras
tends to be identified as the standard route.2 The A tharva Veda men-
tions the pitaras' route without any reference to the route leading to
the deva abode.3 Thus, it seems likely that the pathway leading to
the father's world was understood by many to constitute the
normative destiny of the deceased.
When the deceased arrived in the father's world, Yama, king of
this realm, provided the new arrival with a new body.4 In later
traditions, including the Buddhist, Yama figures prominently in
pronouncing judgement upon the dead.5 But in Rg Veda literature
proper, neither he nor Varuna, who is frequently associated with
the principle of order (rta), function in this capacity.6 After being
established in the fathers' realm, the deceased enjoyed various
pleasurable amenities in a paradisiac setting. The fathers, bathed in
a continual stream of light (a motif that suggests their newly gained
heavenly status)7 enjoyed a diet that consisted of svadha-, (food that
provides them with their essential powers),8 milk, ghee, honey and
soma (all of which constitute the traditional sacrificial libations). In
short, the realm of the fathers seems to represent an ethereal projec-

--- Page 4 ---

tion of the perfect human existence, a scenario which led A. B.
Keith to write: "The picture is relatively simple: it is merely the
pleasant things of earth to the priestly imagination, heaped upon
9
one another... "9
But more importantly, the fathers are imagined as being perfect-
ly capable of determining their own actions on the basis of their own
wills.'° Because they maintain the power to act upon their own voli-
tions, they represent a source of power that can be tapped by the
living. Indeed, they appear to be anxious to come to the aid of their
surviving kin, especially those descendants who provide for them
regularly by offering sacrifices.ll There existed, therefore, a sym-
biotic relationship between the living and the dead. In Rg Vedic
literature, the living call upon the fathers for various types of aid:
for assistance in battle, for food, and for rain. However, the
primary appeal made by the living is for help in continuing the
family lineage.'2 The fathers had a vested interest in furthering the
family line; for, in order to be sustained, they needed sacrifices
performed in their honor. Thus, they more than welcome appeals
for offspring, especially males.
This pattern of relationship between the living and the dead
closely resembles the Vedic conception of the relationship between
human beings and the devas. Just as the majority of Brahmanical
rituals were designed to appease the devas, thereby sustaining their
associated natural and cosmic powers for the purpose of main-
taining favorable this-worldly living conditions, so also the fathers,
when nourished by ritual sacrifices, would benevolently return the
favor of sacrifice by granting boons to descendants. One's
ancestors, therefore, were understood to play a continuing active
role in the affairs of this-worldly existence.
In later developing Brahmanical tradition, the fate of the dead
was somewhat modified. Upanisadic conceptions indicate that
pitaras were not considered immortal, but eventually underwent a
dissolution by returning to the five basic elements of the cosmos.'3
Yet, even with the Upanisadic introduction of karmic theories of
rebirth, a theodicy which would appear to have displaced the an-
cient pattern of belief in the pitaras status, the fundamental pattern
of relationship between the living and the ancestors was not
significantly altered. Indeed, the fate of the dead was further

--- Page 5 ---
5
elaborated and the cosmological status of the fathers classified to
resemble the three-fold classification of the heavenly devas. 14 Cor-
responding to this developing cosmological schema, a system of
ritual sacrifices was designed to insure that the recently deceased
could safely ascend through this triple realm of the departed beyond
human life. Each generation of ancestors was thought to occupy
one of these levels of heaven and to ascend progressively to higher
realms until eventual dissolution.
The rites designed to promote the status of the deceased, known
as irdddha, continue to be celebrated in contemporary Hindu society
even today. Since they are enormously complex, they cannot be
fully explored within the context of this article. 15 However, a
general description will indicate that the ancient Vedic pattern of
reciprocal relationship between the living and the dead was not only
preserved, but expanded and intensified.
The sraddha rites indicate that an important function previously
assigned to Yama has been assumed by surviving kin. No longer is
Yama given the responsibility of providing a newly arrived
deceased with a new body; that task is now the responsibility of the
family. Further, the deceased is no longer understood to make his
way independently to the realm of the fathers by means of "heaven-
ly wings" .16 Immediately after death, the deceased is completely
disembodied and exists in a liminal status. His physical human
body has been cremated, yet his spirit remains in the vicinity. In
this condition, the deceased are known as preta (departed). In addi-
tion to propitiating previous generations of pitaras and aiding them
in their journeys through the triple realm beyond, the primary
function of the sriiddha rites is to transform the deceased from this
liminal condition as a preta to the status of pitr (father). This is done
symbolically, in the manner of sympathetic magic, by ritually
fashioning a body out of rice balls (pirzr,ia) during the first ten days
after death." During each of the first ten days after death, a new
pt'naa is created representing a vital part of the new body. On the
eleventh day, after the rice-body (pinda-pitr) is complete, a complex
series of additional rites is held. Of chief importance among them is
the feasting of the ancestral fathers and the newly deceased, all of
which are symbolically represented by a group of eleven priestly
specialists.'a Through the first eleven days, the mood of srdddha is

--- Page 6 ---
6
generally one of mourning; but on the twelfth day, the concluding
rite known as sapindikarana is held. This is the specific occasion
during which the recently deceased symbolically joins his ancestors
and becomes established as a pitr, 19 Without the performance of
these rituals, the deceased remain as pretas and are regarded as a
source of danger to the living.2° But once established as a pitr, they
gain new bodies and thus regain social status.
Just exactly when this distinction between preta and pitr emerged
within Brahmanical tradition is difficult to assert with any certain-
ty. According to Hopkins,2' the distinction is already assumed in
epic literature. Keith believed that the distinction "can perhaps be
traced right back to Sankhayana",22 a conjecture that would date
the tradition as far back as the time of the Kausitaki Briihmarza. Barua
insists that even during the lifetime of the Buddha, the holy
pilgrimage site of Gaya existed as an auspicious site for the per-
formance of rites transforming pretas to pitaras.23 Far more convinc-
ing is Knipe's analysis in which he concludes that the sraddha feasts
have their origins in the period of briihmana texts and were stead-
fastly preserved in the sutras and the sdstras. 24 These critical con-
siderations suggest that the pattern of ritual activity designed to
promote the deceased from the status of preta to pitr was prevalent
before the emergence of specifically Buddhist conceptions.25
The sriiddha rites were/are a context for the expression of a
number of social and religious beliefs relating to death. For surviv-
ing kin, these rites provide an acceptable social forum for the
expression of grief, a means to grapple with the sense of loss which
accompanies any encounter with death. Those closest in kin to the
deceased are also supported emotionally by the presence of other
family relations. In addition, because previously deceased ancestors
are remembered and symbolically present during the ritual process,
the sriiddha rites also constitute a type of family reunion for both the
dead and the living. Consequently, the collective heritage of the
family is recalled, and familial kinship lines are both publicly and
privately affirmed.
More importantly, irdddha constitutes the fulfilment of an obliga-
tion. By assuring the well-being of the deceased in the after-life, a
debt of filial piety is settled. And if surviving family members hope
to sustain a positive reciprocal relationship with the deceased in the

--- Page 7 ---
7
future, and thus call upon his power as a pitr in times of need, they
must first establish him in a venerable state. Providing for the
ancestors by means of ritual service is a basic familial responsibility,
a way of expressing thanks for their contributions to family life. A
neglected ancestor, especially one that remains as a preta, can
become a meddlesome nuisance or a source of serious family
trouble.
For these reasons, sriiddha functions effectively as a ritual tech-
nique : it serves as a device which establishes the deceased in a state
where the mutual interests of the living and the dead can be real-
ized ; and it provides a means for coping with death's existential
sting and the period of social pollution which immediately follows
death's occurrence.
To sum up, before the emergence of the Buddhist tradition,
Brahmanical conceptions of the after-life were somewhat paradi-
siac, providing that the ritual obligations incumbent upon the living
were met. After the performance of ritual transactions designed to
facilitate the deceased's transition from preta to pitr, the relationship
between the living and the dead was conceived to be reciprocal in
nature, an extended dimension of kinship relations.
Modifications of Brahmanical Beliefs in the Pali Canon
Although the Petavatthu contains a rich source of information
reflecting early Buddhist understandings of the after-life, other
portions of the Pali canon generally considered antecedent to the
Petavatthu contain a number of relevant passages to our discussion.
From these passages, to be found in the Vinaya and the four princi-
ple Nikayas, it is clear that important modifications of prevailing
understandings had already taken place, while some conceptions
had been completely abandoned.
One of the most conspicuous changes in the developing Buddhist
cosmological view concerns the fact that the blissful abode of the
fathers, or a path specifically followed by one's deceased ancestors,
is nowhere to be found. What this seems to suggest is that, along
with the decline in importance attached to the worship of devas,
ancestor veneration suffered a similar dimunition. This does not
necessarily imply that Buddhism rejected the importance of the
family, although this accusation was often levelled against the tradi-

--- Page 8 ---

tion by Brahmanical rivals.26 There are numerous instances within
the Nikayas and the Vinaya where the Buddha enjoins his disciples to
honor father and mother. Indeed, honoring one's parents and
serving them was a cardinal teaching for the laity. 27 However, the
absence of a corresponding conception parallelling the Brahmanical
pitr status, and the fact that no ritual device similar to sriiddha or
sapifldikarana is mentioned in early Buddhist literature, indicates
differing assumptions regarding the fate of the dead. Specifically, it
means that the recently deceased do not ipso facto gain a bliss-filled
and honored position in the after-life as a result of sacrificial ritual
techniques or because of their status as family ancestors.
According to the Buddhist understanding, the destiny of the
deceased is directly the consequence of how well he conducted
himself morally during his human life span. While this idea of
karmic retribution was certainly permeating Brahmanical thought
during this time, it never completely succeeded in supplanting the
patterns of belief and rite that we have described earlier in this
paper. Ancestor veneration, and attendant conceptions of the after-
life, existed side by side with the theory of karma. In early Buddhist
literature, however, the karmic theory of moral retribution became
the basic cornerstone for developing lore portraying life after death.
Unlike the fate of the pitaras and their after-worldly existence, the
notion of preta was not abandoned by the Buddhists. It was,
however, dramatically transformed in significance. Petas (Pali for
Sanskrit preta) were no longer considered to be potentially
dangerous beings existing in a liminal phase of transition between
the statuses of human being and pitr. According to the Vinaya and
the Nikiiyas, the term peta could still refer to a recently deceased,28
but it might also refer to a being who had been deceased for quite a
long period of time.29 The realm in which petas dwell, petaloka,
occupied a fixed position in the cosmos; and, whenever the different
strata of conditioned samsaric existence are mentioned, it is iden-
tified as a realm existing immediately below the realm of human be-
ings, yet still above the animal realm and the tortuous hells.3° While
the Nikiiyas and the Vinaya do not specifically elaborate upon the
conditions of petas, they do assume that they suffer from gruesome
and lurid afflictions which make them less than human. The Vinaya
even refers to petas as a way of defining that which is not human.3'

--- Page 9 ---
9
The fact that both bhikkhu and bhikkhunni Vinayas prescribe disci-
plined behavior in relation to petas indicates that it was commonly
believed that petas could appear within the human realm.32 Despite
their gruesome condition, there is no evidence suggesting that petas
were regarded as a dreaded source of mischief. On the other hand,
their status is referred to as "untimely" because they merely realize
the fruit of action and cannot initiate works on their own accord.33
The Mahdvastu, while not a Pali source, holds them in the same
regard. It contains a vivid account of how petas as hungry ghosts,
grieve over their powerless condition.34
Furthermore, the peta status did not amount to a destiny or tran-
sitional phase through which all recently deceased must pass. The
Anguttara Nikiiya states that only those who commit one of the "ten
wrong ways of action" are destined for rebirth in petaloka.35 The
Samyutta Nikiiya echoes the same generalization but states it posi-
tively : those who are virtuous in upholding the paEcasila36 (the five
basic moral precepts) or "walk in faith" 37 will avoid petaloka. These
passages consistently predicate existence as a peta upon the living of
an irreligious life. There is, however, one reference in the Anguttara
Niktiya which seems to preserve the Brahmanical association of
pretas with neglected familial obligations: those who live an immoral
life by not honoring father and mother, such as recluses and
brahmins, will be judged by Yama as "abusers" destined for
petaloka, the anim4 realm, or Niraya hell. 38 Neglecting one's parents
is considered pre-eminently "immoral" . Thus, the Buddhist inclu-
sion of this Brahmanical motif is clothed within the context of an
ethical injunction.
There are many passages in the Nikdyas expressing a low regard
for ritual sacrifice, but only two that refer to Brahmanical funeral
practices and none that indicate a specifically Buddhist practice.
The first reference to Brahmanical practice occurs in the Tevijja Sutta
of the Digha Nikdya 39 and scoffs at prayers to Indra, Soma, Varuna,
Isana, Brahma and Prajapati to aid the deceased in becoming
united with Brahman after death. Thus, this passage does not refer
to the intentions of sriiddha and sapz'ndaka-rana. But a second passage
found in the Sajtiyatana Book of the Samyutta Nikdya 40 does. The son of
a snake charmer and apparently a village headman asks the Buddha
about the practices of brahmins who, when a man has died, "lift

--- Page 10 ---
10
him up and carry him out, call on him by name, and speed him
heavenwards". The Buddha's reply is in the form of questions
directed at the headman and signals the Buddhist orthodox doc-
trinal attitude toward the central function of sapindikarana. In short,
the Buddha asks if murderers, liars, backbiters, etc. will attain
heaven even if a multitude sing his praises and say: "May this
man, when body breaks up, after death be reborn in the Happy
Lot, in the Heaven World". The Buddha then compares such a
practice to commanding a huge rock to float on water. Finally, he
says that only those who abide by the basic moral precepts attain
heaven. Ethical action has replaced ritual technique.
Briefly, Buddhist canonical literature antecedent to the Petavatthu
reveals significant departures from prevailing Brahmanical patterns
of belief and rite. The most important change involves the
dominating presence of the karmic theory of moral retribution in
determining the nature of the after-life. The destiny of the deceased
was not determined on the basis of ritual devices, nor by one's
ancestral status. Rather, the nature of existence in after-life
depended solely on the moral quality of human actions. While the
status of pitr was abandoned, the status of preta was transformed.
No longer considered as a liminal phase, it represented a suffering
existence awaiting those who had acted immorally while among the
living. Unlike the deceased ancestors of Brahmanical tradition,
these Buddhist dead are powerless. There is no reciprocal relation-
ship between human and superhuman beings; and there is no tex-
tual evidence suggesting that the living perform any type of actions
on behalf of the dead. This brings us to the significance of Petavatthu
literature.
The Significance of Merit Transference in Petavatthu Literature
The Petavatthu (literally: "Stories of the Departed") is an
anthology of short stories purportedly Buddhavacana ("sayings"
ascribed to the Buddha). However, its content and style are
decidedly at odds with the four principal Nikdyas and the Vinaya. As
those texts bear the heavy stamp of scholastic formulation, Petavat-
thu literature belies a folkloristic origin. While it is impossible to
reconstruct the reasons for its inclusion within the canon, it is not
unreasonable to suppose that it was belatedly included because of

--- Page 11 ---
11
its widespread popular appeal among the laity. The Mahavamsa
claims that Mahinda, Asoka's missionary son to Sri Lanka, recited
the text as one of his first ploys to convert the island masses to Bud-
dhism.41 Henry Gehman, who first translated the anthology into
English in 1938, believes that the stories were utilized by monks in
preaching sermons to the laity. Overemphasizing, and reducing the
importance of the text to a "mercenary motivation", he suggests
that the exclusive purpose of the stories was to raise material sup-
port for the monastic community.42 By that, he implies that the sole
intent behind the giving of canonical status to the text was to cajole
the laity into actively and lavishly patronizing the monastic com-
munity. There is no doubt that this motif is central to the text and
we shall explore its significance more fully in subsequent pages. But
the full meaning of the stories cannot be completely comprehended
if we confine our analysis to a materialistic interpretation based
upon an analysis of the patron/client relationship.
These stories may have been delivered as sermons by monks, but
they reflect basic religious assumptions intrinsic to the spiritual
world view of the common folk. Consequently, fundamental
Brahmanical assumptions, abandoned or ignored in more
scholastic texts, resurface in the Petavatthu clothed in new garb.
Although veneration of the dead and grieving over their departure
from life is firmly discouraged in at least six of the fifty-one tales,43
the ancient Brahmanical belief that the living in some way benefit
the dead in their after-life existence persists. The new means by
which this is accomplished is through the transfer of merit, a prac-
tice advocated in eighteen stories.44
The structure of the plot of the overwhelming majority of Petavat-
thu stories follows a fixed formula. A certain individual, almost
always a lay person,45 commits an immoral action out of
selfishness, hatred, or delusion. When that individual dies, he or
she is reborn in petaloka, suffering from a condition of woe physical-
ly mirroring the nature of the committed wrong.46 The peta then
appears to the living, sometimes to a surviving kinsman,4' who
recoils in disgust. The peta then proceeds to tell how his misconduct
resulted in such a hideous condition of suffering. Either the story
ends at this point, at it does in twenty-eight stories'8 with the lesson
of karmic retribution vividly illustrated, or it continues. If con-

--- Page 12 ---

tinued, the peta makes a request: the living should offer a gift to the
bhikkhusafigha and transfer the merit derived from that virtuous
action to the suffering peta. Once the gift is made, the peta is greatly
relieved of physical torment and very often transformed into the
status of a deva.4,9 The brief tale that follows is highly illustrative of
the style and content of most of the stories. It contains the basic
patterns of belief and practice which make Petavatthu literature
distinctive and relevant to the purpose of this discussion.
THE STORY OF NANDA
While the Teacher was living at Jetavana, he told this story:
In a certain village not far from Savatthi there was a certain disci-
ple believing and pious. His wife, Nanda by name, however, was
unbelieving, irreligious, avaricious, quick-tempered, rough in her
speech, and disrespectful and disobedient to her husband; she
would rail like a drum and indulge in abuse. Dying and reborn as a
peti, she sojourned near that same village. Then one day she
appeared before the lay disciple Nandasena, as he was coming out
of the village. When he saw her, he addressed her with this stanza:
1. "Dark and ugly appearance you are; your body is rough and
you are horrible to behold. You are red-eyed; you have yellow
teeth. I deem that you are not human".
The Peti:
2. "I am Nanda, Nandasena; formerly I was your wife. For having
been abusive, I went hence to the peta-world".
Nandasena:
3. "Now what wicked deed was committed by body, speech, or
mind? In consequence of what act have you gone from here to the
peta-world"?
The Peti: .
4. "I was wrathful and rough in speech, and I also showed no
reverence to you. Therefore, for using abusive language, I went
from here to the peta-world".
Nandasena:
5. "Come, I give you a cloak; put on this garment. When you have
put it on, come, I will lead you home.

--- Page 13 ---
13
6. Clothes and food and drink you shall obtain, if you come home.
You will behold your sons, and you shall see your daughter a
villain".
The Peti:
7. "What is given by your hand into mine does not profit me. But
as regards the monks, who are abounding in the moral precepts,
free from passion, and learned,
8. Regale them with food and drink and transfer to me the benefit
of the gift. Then I shall be happy, blest in the fulfilment of all
desires" . .
9. Then promising with the words, "Very well", he made abun-
dant gifts: food, drink, solid food, clothes, dwelling, umbrellas,
perfumes, wreathes, and various kinds of sandals. After he had
refreshed with food and drink the monks who were abounding in
the moral precepts, free from passion, and learned, he transferred
to her the virtue of the gift.
10. Immediately thereafter, when credit for this was transferred to
her, the result came to pass. Of the gift, this was the fruit: food,
clothes, and drink.
11. Then pure, having clean clothes, wearing the finest Benares
cloth, bedecked with various garments and ornaments, she
approached her husband.
Nandasena:
12. "0 devi, you are of excellent appearance, you are illuminating
all the regions like the morning star.
13. Because of what do you have such an appearance? On account
of what is happiness your portion here, and why fall to your lot
whatever pleasures are dear to the heart?
14. I ask you, devi, very powerful one, you who have become
human, what good deed have you done? Why have you such
radiant majesty, and why does your splendour illuminate all the
regions"?
The peti:
15. "I am Nanda, Nandasena; formerly I was your wife. For hav-
ing committed an evil deed, I went from here to the peta-world.
Through the gift given by you, I rejoice, being free from fear from
any quarter.

--- Page 14 ---
14
16. May you live long, householder, with all your kinsmen; may
you attain the abode free from sorrow and passion, the dwelling of
those who have willpower.
17. Here living the religious life and giving gifts, householder, may
you remove the stain of selfishness together with its roots and enter
heaven blameless" .50
The central teaching of Petavatthu literature is the efficacy of kar-
mic actions. Consistent with this bedrock assumption, Nanda suf-
fers as a peti for her misguided human actions. The major doctrinal
dilemma herein concerns the problem of how to integrate the theory
of karma with what, at first sight, appears to be undoctrinal
behavior, e. g. , performing actions on behalf of the dead which pro-
mote their status in the after-life. 51 Maurice Winternitz referred to
this practice as a serious blemish on the theory of karmic deter-
minism.52 In the following pages of analysis, we shall first identify
Brahmanical patterns present in this story, discuss the theoretical
rationale for their inclusion (especially the practice of merit
transfer), and determine the sociological implications for their ac-
comodation. Finally, we shall conclude with some general remarks
concerning how this Buddhist transformation of Brahmanical
patterns of belief and rite relating to the dead reflects an increasing
valorization of the human condition.
Nanda's request that her husband perform actions on her behalf
is sharply reminiscent of sriiddha and sapindikarana ritual intentions.
The status that her husband wins for her, devi, is much akin to the
heavenly career of a pitr. Transfigured from the status of peti, she
not only enjoys the satisfying worldly amenities of food and drink,
but she also gains a new lustrous body. In addition, Nanda ex-
presses her wish that her surviving family will be long-lived, a motif
that we first identified as a concern of the pitaras (fathers) for the
family. Thus, three fundamental patterns of Brahmanical origin
are present: the deceased is transformed from the status of preta to
heavenly existence and given a new body, a potent and vicarious
action on the deceased's behalf facilitates such a transfiguration,
and concern for the continuation of family lineage is expressed. If
our analysis ended at this juncture of the discussion, we might
conclude that the Petavatthu simply offers old wine in new bottles.
But this is not entirely the case.

--- Page 15 ---
15
The Petavatthu stories are saturated with illustrations of karmic
retribution. It is, as we have indicated, the fundamental teaching of
the anthology. The initial episodes of Nanda' story are but a series
of images reflecting an orthodox doctrinal understanding of the kar-
mic process at work. In the opening scene, Nanda's spiritual
demeanor is compared to that of her believing and pious husband.
It is clear that it is her disposition, the qualitative state of her mind
as conditioned by the dsavas (raga, dosa, and moha: passion, hatred,
and delusion), which generate her abusive actions. And when she
appears to Nandasena, he immediately asks: "Now, what wicked
deed was committed by body, speech, or mind"? This three-fold
formula is consistently used throughout the Vinaya and the Nikayas
to designate the means by which behavioral expressions mirror
mental disposition.53 In an often cited passage of the Anguttara
Nikiiya, the Buddha says: "0 bhikkhus, it is volition that I call
karma. Having willed, one acts through body, speech, and mind" 5'
In the case of Nandd, it is clear that she either does not have the
discipline to control the dsavas by means of mental discrimination
(viiiiiiina),55 or if she does, she refuses to exercise her will to act right.
The abstract principles expressed in this example constitute the
Theravada understanding of karma: a mentally unhealthy disposi-
tion causally produces immoral actions which in turn produce a
perpetuation of suffering. In other words: psychological condition-
ing of the mind leads to behavioral expressions in the social context
which have future cosmic soteriological consequences. One's future
status in the after-life according to this perspective, is wholly deter-
mined by one's ability to will into action a morally wholesome
demeanor. It is precisely this ethic, so heavily emphasized in the
Pali canon, that has led many Western observers to typologize
Theravada Buddhism as a religion of "self effort", rather than as a
"religion of grace ' ' . 5 6
Now the question arises: how can the strict determinism of
karmic retribution reconcile the merit transferring activities that
Nandasena performs on behalf of his wife? Or on what theoretical
bases can Buddhism legitimate its incorporation of this originally
Brahmanical pattern of belief?
A traditionally Buddhist explanation has been given by
Malalasekera.57 In explaining how pari'va.t.ta (transferring merit) is

--- Page 16 ---
16
consistent with the Buddhist theory of karma, he focuses his discus-
sion upon the mental dispositions of both the doer of the deed (in
our example, Nandasena) and the beneficiary (Nanda). With
reference to the doer, he says: "The act of sharing one's good for-
tune is a deed of compassion and friendliness and, as such, very
praiseworthy and meritorious" .58 In other words, the act of giving
(ddna), is ethically productive because it is rooted in a selfless
disposition of compassion directed toward the assuaging of
another's suffering. With reference to the beneficiary, he says: "the
recipient of the transfer becomes a participant of the original deed
by associating himself with it. Thus the identification of himself
with both the deed and the doer can sometimes result in the
beneficiary getting even greater merit than the original doer, either
because his elation is greater or because his appreciation of
the value of deed is more intellectual, and therefore more
meritorious" .59 Re-emphasizing the importance of the mind's con-
dition, he goes on to say that "what is significant is that in order to
share in the good deed done by another, there must be approval of
it and joy in the beneficiary's heart... Here, too, as in all actions, it
is the thought which according to Buddhism, really matters" .60
Malalasekera's theoretical explanation thus renders the story of
Nanda and her transformation doctrinally acceptable. According to
this perspective, Nanda's transformation from peti to deai results
from her husband's compassionate act of selfless giving and her
own ability to intellectually appreciate, and therefore rejoice in the
virtue of a meritorious deed.
This rationale for merit transfer, based upon the theory of
karma, begs a comparison with the Brahmanical rationale. First, it
is clear that like their Brahmanical counterparts, Buddhist petas
remain dependent upon the living to perform catalytic actions on
their behalf. However the Buddhist transformation of petas involves
a transformation of mind, and not just body. The shining
luminescence of the deai status is but a cosmological reflection of
Nanda's newly found spiritually healthy mind. Second, as Knipe
notes with reference to the Brahmanical sapindikarana transaction,
the transformation of pretas to pitaras involved the liturgical applica-
tion of an ancient cosmogonic model to an individual's postcrema-
tion passage. With such an "understanding of the passage of the

--- Page 17 ---
17
deceased as a cosmogonic progression,... an individual's salvation
[was] dependent on the correct ritual activity of his descendants" 61
In comparison, the Buddhist incorporation of this deep-seated
Brahmanical belief is justified on a psychological and ethical basis,
rather than upon the magical efficacy of ritual actions.
It needs to be noted, however, that the psychological and
(therefore) ethical explanation by Malalasekera is something of an
ad hoc rationalization legitimating actions performed on behalf of
the dead on karmalogical grounds. Gombrich has examined the
issue thoroughly by focussing upon the changed meaning of the
term anumodana, the word used by Malalasekera to connote "rejoic-
ing" .62 On the basis of his philological study, he has determined
that anumodana originally conveyed a meaning of thanksgiving, or
gratitude, that existed between the doer of an action and its
beneficiary.63 Only when merit transfer required doctrinal justifica-
tion did its meaning shift from "gratitude" to "joy" or "empathy
in joy" .64 Gombrich suggests that this shift in meaning probably
occurred around two thousand years ago,65 or about the time of the
Petavatthu's collation. Thus, the substance of Malalasekera's argu-
ment is by no means new. Indeed, the theoretical framework of the
Petavatthu has implicitly incorporated it. Moreover, in almost all of
the Petavatthu stories, the protagonists (those who have committed
irreligious acts) hardly inspire a spirit of gratitude or thanksgiving
amongst their surviving kin. Rather, the most obvious motivations
for survivors to perform merit transfer on behalf of the dead are
compassion and selfless giving, motivations which agree much
more easily with the karmic theory of action.
Yet, as Gombrich further has pointed out, there is one passage in
what could be one of the most ancient strands of Petavatthu literature
that gives, as a rationale for merit transfer, the motive of gratitude
or thanksgiving. The passage is also found in the Tirokudda Sutta of
the Khuddakape?tha and constitutes the Buddha's explanation to
King Bimbisara of the plight of the petas. Here we find the stanza:
He gave to me, he worked for me,
He was my kin, my friend, my intimate,
Give gifts, then, for the departed ones,
Recalling what they used to do.6s

--- Page 18 ---
18
In this passage, which on the whole constitutes a theoretical
anomaly in the Petavatthu, we find the same motive for merit
transfer amongst Buddhists as we did for Sriiddha amongst
Brahmanical counterparts. Just as Brahmanical family survivors
fulfilled their dharmic obligations out of gratitude for the deceased
family member, so are Buddhists here enjoined to do the same.
Gombrich's analysis has succeeded in identifying the cultural and
social roots of Buddhist merit transfer in Brahmanical tradition.
The stories of the Petavatthu, therefore, for the most part, provide a
new Buddhist theoretical basis for the continuation of this popular
act of piety.
There remains, however, one other doctrinal consideration
which Malalasekera and Gombrich have not examined in any great
depth. This concerns the role of bhikkhus in the merit transfer trans-
action within the context of the Petavatthu's karmalogical rationale.
Bhikkhus are considered the virtuous objects of such actions and
their presence makes possible the fortunate consequences that result
for the deceased. Within this karmalogical understanding, the
qualitative condition of the object is just as important as the mental
condition of the subject if the action is to bear genuinely auspicious
fruit. 61 In this connection, we can understand the importance of the
collective ritual life of the monastic community. It constitutes,
primarily, an aggregate expression of the bhikkhus' continuously
"pure" moral status. 68 In other words, it legitimates bhikkhus as
being worthy objects of meritorious actions. It makes them an
indispensable part of merit transfer; for petas, because of their
irreligious acts that result in lowly spiritual conditions, cannot fulfil
this doctrinally needed function. That is why in our example of
Petavatthu literature, virtuous bhikkhus, rather than the peti Nandd,
must be the object of Nandasena's action. Moreover, explicit
recognition of the bhikkhus' status is made when Nandd describes
them as "abounding in moral precepts, free from passion, and
learned". Nanda's three-fold description is but another way of
identifying the religious life of the bhikkhus with the three-fold basis
of the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path: sfla ("abounding in moral
precepts"), samiidhi ("free from passion") and pafifiti ("learned").
What this again illustrates is the karmalogical rationale for merit
transfer replacing Brahmanical faith in ritual techniques. And

--- Page 19 ---
19
within the context of this rationale, the act of merit transfer con-
stitutes a cultic celebration of that which symbolizes the Buddha's
Dhamma: the presence of bhikkhus. Hence, the spiritual values
intrinsic to the Buddha's Dhamma replace those cultically express-
ed within the sriiddha rites (filial piety as a dharmic obligation).
Consequently, the bhikkhusangha replaces the "extended"
Brahmanical family as the primary socio-religious unit of impor-
tance in conjunction with patterns of belief and rite related to the
deceased.69 This brings us to our final consideration.
Socio-religious Implications of the Petavatthu Rationale
Within the scope of the Petavatthu's teachings, bhikkhus not only
replace the Brahmanical family as the primary socio-religious unit,
but they also replace the deceased as cultic objects of veneration.
We have already noted that in early Buddhism, there existed no
reciprocal relationship between the living and the dead. However,
like the Brahmanical priest of the irdddha rites performed on the
eleventh day of ritual observance, bhikkhus continue the tradition of
symbolizing the presence of the dead as well.
As we noted in our brief scenario of the sriiddha transaction, the
fashioning of pindas (rice balls) plays a key role: they are a symbol of
the newly created body for the deceased and also constitute food
offerings to the dead in order to allay hunger and thirst. 70 The prac-
tice of giving alms in the Buddhist context (the virtuous action per-
formed by Nandasena in our example) is known within Buddhist
circles as pindapata ("the casting of pinda"). Thus, pifldas are the
alms which literally provide sustenance for the bhikkhus. Like the
libations of the ancient ritual sacrifice that sustained pitaras, and
like the pindas of sriiddha, this giving of alms represents one side of
an important reciprocal relationship. But here, the reciprocal
relationship is strictly between the living.
Motifs associating the dead with bhikkhus are not entirely lacking
in Buddhist tradition. In addition to the practice of pindapata, bhik-
khus are often referred to as those who have "gone forth" (pabba-
ja-the term signaling the rite of renouncing society and gaining a
new rebirth within the sacred world of Buddhist monasticism). As
many scholars have indicated, this renunciation theoretically
renders the initiate as "dead to the world", separated from the

--- Page 20 ---
20
world of the laity.'1 And further, because bhikkhus are living the
paradigmatic existence laid down by the Tathagata (the one who
has "gone forth"-the Buddha), they symbolize the urge to
overcome rebirth, to go beyond (parangata).'2
If we can speak of a relationship between the living and the
"dead" in early Buddhism, it is the reciprocal relationship existing
between the laity and bhikkhus. As pitaras were a source of power to
be tapped by the Brahmanical living, so are bhikkhus in the Buddhist
context. Throughout the Petavatthu and other early Buddhist
literature, the Buddha and his followers (the bhikkhusangha) are con-
sistently identified as the most auspicious fields for the making of
merit. Whenever actions are performed which take either Buddha
or Sangha as their object, powerful karmic consequences, such as
the transfiguration of petas, result. Thus in return for pindapata,
bhikkhus become a source of transformative spiritual power for the
laity.
Within the practice of pt'??aapa-ta, those sacrificial offerings former-
ly given to ancestors through Brahmanical priests are now given to
the bhikkhusangha. The Petavatthu pedagocially supports this tradition
but justifies it on the basis of the spiritual virtues associated with the
path that bhikkhus symbolize. That is, gifts given to the bhikkhus
have a different motivational basis than in the Brahmanical context
(they are not given because the bhikkhu is a priest who possesses
special knowledge necessary to make ritual observance efficacious).
It is impossible to assess whether or not the Petavatthu compilers in-
cluded various stories within the collection on the basis of whether
or not alms to bhikkhus were advocated. Only twenty-four out of the
51 explicitly promote the practice.'3 However, wherever the idea of
merit-transfer is inculcated, gifts to the bhikkhus are required
without exception. How do we evaluate this pattern? Is it the conse-
quence of the need to make merit-transfer karmalogically consistent
(bhikkhus are needed as virtuous objects to make the action produc-
tive) ? Or, as Gehman asserts, were the stories of Petavatthu canon-
ized because they are aimed at exacting alms from the laity by
means of threatening them with the possibility of becoming petas?
To agree completely with Gehman is to strip the text of any
spiritual significance and to blandly ignore the nature of the tran-
sactions we have tried to describe. While there are, no doubt,

--- Page 21 ---
21
unscrupulous clerics present in all ages and places, we would do
much better by seeing the practice of pindapata as maintaining two
ancient Indian practices rooted in Brahmanical tradition. The first
is obvious: holy men in India have been supported from time im-
memorial through the giving of alms by the laity. The second is
that, within the Buddhist context, the entity sustained by these
practices is the bhikkhusangha. That is, as the sriiddha rites and
sapirzr,iikarana sustain the "extended" Brdhmanical family in this-
world and the next, so does the analogous Buddhist practice sustain
the Sangha, which constitutes the primary sociological unit within
the Buddhist purview. Giving alms to bhikkhus, then, is at once the
continuation of a general tradition and the consequence of
substituting one socio-religious entity for another in a newly emerg-
ing religious communal structure. How calculated this substitution
was, in fact remains a moot question. That it could be doctrinally
legitimated is evident from our discussion.
Summarizing our argument, we may say that Buddhist transfor-
mations of Brahmanical patterns of belief and rite pertaining to
death and the after-life indicate an increasing importance attached
to this-worldly activity. Life beyond death was determined by the
quality of moral actions performed before death. Various
cosmological realms were envisaged as reflecting the mental condi-
tions of the living. The dead assumed their after-life status on the
basis of their mental dispositions as humans rather than upon their
status as ancestors. Further, the dead were stripped of their power
to act efficaciously in the human realm and became totally depen-
dent upon actions performed on their behalf by the living. Conse-
quently, the relationship between the living and the dead ceased to
be symbiotic and became unilateral. While assisting the dead in the
after-life constitutes a continuation of Brahmanical belief, the Bud-
dhists fashioned their own theoretical justification based upon the
ideas of karmic retribution. Here, merit transfer became a virtuous
action because both doer and beneficiary could recognize and
rejoice in the intrinsic goodness of the act. And rather than
constituting an act of ancestor veneration, merit transfer, an action
involving support for the bhikkhusangha, constituted a cultic venera-
tion of the Buddha's Dhamma, which was symbolized by the
presence of virtuous bhikkhus. As such, the Sangha replaced the

--- Page 22 ---
22
ancestors and the Brahmanical family as the primary social unit of
importance in connection with actions performed on behalf of the
dead. Each of these transformations reflect either an ethicization of
this-worldly action or an increasing importance attached to the
efficacy of human life.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this discussion in no way exhausts the significance
of merit transfer or ancestor worship in Indian religious traditions.
In Buddhist tradition, the idea of merit transfer was largely
expanded in the various Mahayana schools. It became the means
by which bodhisattvas such as Ksitigarbha and Amitäbha were
thought to rescue suffering sentient beings from the rounds of
samsaric rebirth. In the Burmese, Sinhalese and Thai Theraväda
traditions, merit transfer continued to play a role in funeral rites
and memorial services for the dead.
The patterns of relationship between the living and the dead
which we have discussed in this paper also underwent further
transformations within the burgeoning classical Hindu tradition. In
the Purtiflas,7' the meaning of the sriiddha rites was brought within
the karmic framework of the samsaralmoksa (rebirth/release) soterio-
logical formula. Undertaking pilgrimage to Gaya became a ritually
meritorious action believed to assure the attainment of moksa for
departed kin as well as for the pilgrim-participant. 75 Because the
Buddha, understood within this context to be an incarnation of
Visnu, and Bodh Gaya, understood to be an auspicious site of
sacred power, figure heavily in this Hindu pilgrimage process,
Buddhist patterns of belief and action were in turn modified and
reincorporated within the ever-absorbing Hindu religious tradition.
These developments await further study.
Furthermore, the Buddhist transformations with which we have
been concerned must be seen as only a portion of a general process
at work during the historical epoch when the Petavatthu was collated.
While Buddhism may have originated as primarily a cloistered
community of ascetic mendicants, by the time of the Emperor
Asoka, it had become a religion of mass appeal: that is, it had
begun to develop an appealing lay ethos of its own. Consequently,
it appropriated, in addition to motifs associated with ancestor

--- Page 23 ---
23
veneration, such practices as paritta (reciting scriptural passages as a
means of generating magical protection), offering prayers to the
Buddha (in hopes of enlisting his powerful assistance), and reciting
the Buddha's name (as another means of gaining protection). Like
merit transfer, these practices can be strictly understood as "undoc-
trinal", for they have no canonical basis. It must be remembered,
however, that the canon was always the basis for monastic religious
life and as such is the product of the monastic mindset. Even the
goal of heaven, which became the goal of the laity and the believed
destiny of transformed petas, was never the advocated goal of the
monastic path. It was regarded as only another state of transitory
existence that must ultimately be transcended. However, its
promulgation amongst the laity by the monastic community, as
evidenced by the Petavatthu collection, suggests that the monastic
community eventually recognized the need for a broader
soteriological appeal if the religion were to be sustained practically.
To that end, scholastics may have doctrinally legitimated such
behavior as merit transfer in order to further the needs of the
religion, both materially and spiritually. In so doing, they para-
doxically, on the level of doctrine, encouraged the attainment of a
conditioned samsaric existence (heaven) for an increasing number of
their lay constituency. The Buddhist transformation of patterns of
belief and rite associated with the dead, then, was but part of this
popularizing process. At the same time, it gave sanction to a
religiously deep-seated and culturally ancient impulse to assist the
dead in the after-life and also emphasized the re-emerging impor-
tance of the heavenly goal, i.e. a goal readily attainable by the
living of a morally wholesome life. As such, it revalorized the im-
portance of actions performed in the human realm, thus reasserting
the soteriological significance of this-worldly existence.

pollution. This could be the reason why the period during which �r�ddwhaa s

liminal status of the preta during this time recalls Mary Douglas's thesis that
liminality connotes danger because an entity is between classification thereby defy-
ing ritual techniques to maintain order. See Douglas, Purity and Danger( Baltimore:
Penguin Books, 1966). It also helps to explain why the mah�p�trwash, o symbolize

the preta and his ancestors, are held in such low social esteem, by virtue of their
association with death.
21 E. Washburn Hopkins, Epic Mythology( Strassburg: Verlag Von Karl F.
Trübner, 1915; reprint ed., Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1974), pp. 29-31. Hopkins
notes that in the epics, the pitaras are worshipped not only by men, but by the devas.
By now, pretas are being described as ghastly and tortured beings. Their association
with pollution is also clear: until they are transformed into pitaras, they are treated
"like outcastes". Unlike pitaras who are consistently identified with specific
ancestors, pretas, again perhaps because of their liminality, are rarely identified
with deceased individuals. When they appear in epic literature, it is usually as a
host of troops in battle.
22 Keith, Religiono f the Veda,2 :412-13, argues that the term preta is unknown in
Rg Vedal iterature proper and its insertion as a liminal phase contradicts the Rg Veda
understanding that the deceased immediately joins the pitaras. But Monier-
Williams notes that preta is derived from pr�( the prefix "pra" meaning "forth"
and the root Vi meaning "to go") and is found in its intensive form preyatei n a
hymn to the Goddess of Dawn, Usas, who makes the dark "depart" (Rg Veda
7.77.). It is then used in the Br�hmanasU, panisadsa nd the Laws of Manu as "to
die". The actual term preta seems to have been first used, according to Monier-
Williams, in the �atapathaB r�hmanab efore its widespread employment in the
Mah�bh�raatna d the Grhya S�tras,s ee Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-EnglishD ic-
tionary, s.v. preta, p. 711. C. A. F. Rhys Davids erroneously speculated that the
term preta was a corruption of pitr, Indian Religiona nd its Survival( London: Williams
and Norgate, 1935), p. 35.
23 Barua's argument is somewhat strained. It is based upon the appearance of
the term astak�(d enoting memorial services for the dead held three or four times a
year) in both the VinayaM ah�vaggaan d the Ud�na(r eferences that I checked and
was unable to locate and confirm). Barua claims that Buddhagosa and Dhar-
mapala both misunderstood the technical sense of the term, and thus did not com-
prehend its meaning as referring to a ceremony in which oblations were offered to
the dead. He says that P�lir eferences to astak�w hen correctly understood, are
"historically important as proving beyond doubt that even during the life-time of
the Buddha the annual bathing in the holy waters of Gaya tank and river was con-
nected with the special funeral ceremonies called astak�st,h e last round of which
comprised the eight days between Magha and Phalguna. In other words, Gay�
was, even at that early period of existence, a holy region for the performance of
funeral obsequies and the offering of pindas". Benimadhab Barua, Gay�an d Buddha

25 Keith, Religiono f the Veda,2 :414-15, speculates that the origins of pretas, and
hence Buddhist P�lpi etas, may be due to a transmutation of tree and water spirits.
This guess is not entirely without justification; for in the Petavatthu,s ometimes petas
are addressed as yakkhas;f urther, in modern Sri Lank�p, etas are frequently and con-
fusingly associated with the same. See Richard Gombrich, Precepta nd Practice:

Ibid., pp. 6-7, 7-11, 11-13, 16-18, 19-21, 27-29, 29-32, 32-35, 36-37, 41-43,
44-45, 54-56, 69-72, 77-78, 93-97, 98-99, 99-100, and 105-107.
45 In all but two stories (ibid., pp. 3-4 and 4-5) where the protagonist is a bhikkhu.
46 For example, a laywoman in one story (ibid., 11-13) conspires against another
woman to make sure that she does not bear children. She is reborn in petalokaw here
every morning she gives birth to five children and every evening must devour
them. In another story (pp. 4-5), a man consistently slandering others is reborn in
petalokaw ith a mouth full of worms. In yet another (pp. 29-32), a woman (Sariput-
ta's mother), reviled bhikkhuss aying, "Eat dung, drink urine, drink blood, eat the
brain of your mother". The story continues: "Taken up at death by the power of
karma, she was reborn as a peti who endured misery in conformity with her
misbehavior". A lurid description follows.
47 The pattern here is that if the story is to include merit transfer, the peta almost
always appears to surviving kin. If merit transfer is not included in the story, the
peta usually appears to a bhikkhuw ho then purportedly tells the Buddha of his en-
counter with the peta.

48 All stories excepting those indicated in note 44 above, and five others (ibid.,
pp. 7-11, 14-16, 23-26, 38-41, and 63-66), some of which are also found in the
j�takasa nd in the Vim�navatthu).
49 In Pali literature, the devasa re greatly reduced in importance in comparison
to their Br�hmanical role. They must be reborn as human beings if they are to
enter upon the bhikkhup ath to nibb�naT. he devas tatus is, therefore, not a final goal
to be attained, but only the favorable result of virtuous deeds performed while
living the lay religious life as a human.
50 Ibid., pp. 36-37.
51A s we noted, the deceased as petas are in special need because of their suffer-
ing and powerless plight. There is no indication in Pali literature of surviving
kinsmen transferring merit to those assumed to have attained heavenly status.
Further, those reborn in hell or the animal abode seem to be beyond help.

65 Winternitz assigns the Petavatthu correctly to the latest strata of literature
assembled in the canon, Winternitz, Historyo f IndianL iterature,2 :99. He notes that
even Dharmapala, in his commentary, believed that there was a substantial inter-
val between the text and the life of the Buddha, despite the fact that all but eleven
of the stories begin with the stock phrase, "When the teacher was dwelling at.....,
he told this story" . In any case, the patterns with which we are dealing are, accor-
ding to Gombrich, at least 2000 years old. Gombrich, "Merit Transference",
p. 218.

68 In this connection, it is important to note that p�timokkhaan d pav�ranr�itu als,
which express the collectively pure status of the Sangha in relation to the Vinaya
rules, are held immediately before merit-making activities of the laity such as
uposatha and kathina. See my "Ritual Expression in the Vinayapitaka: A
Prolegomenon", History of Religions1 8 (August, 1978): 42-53.
69 In the soteriological sense, the Sangha might be regarded as the new
"extended" family. I owe this suggestive insight to Professor John Strong, private
communication.

71 S. J. Tambhiah, for instance, in his Buddhisma nd Spirit Cults in North-East
Thailand (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1970), p. 65, writes
"Buddhism is dramatically anti-brahmanical in enjoining contemplation of and
contact with death as a major preoccupation of the monk. The accent is on visiting
graveyards, confrontation with death and corpses, meditation on death to under-
stand the transitoriness of life. The wearing of the pamsakulinar ags gathered from
graveyards is an extreme gesture of this absorption with death".
