Religious Donations, Ritual Offerings, and Humanitarian Aid:
Fields of Practice According to Forms of Giving in Burma1

Abstract
Inthispaper,thereligiousdonation–meaningorientedinteractionsthatoccurbetweenalaydonor
andhisorher monastic recipientor between laypeople andreligiousinstitutionsasawhole–isfirst
examined in the Burmese Buddhist context, in regard to the Maussian theory of the gift. The
formal analysis of ‘serving rice’ to monks during their daily alms tour, the main form of religious
donation, demonstrates that it is in keeping with the definition of a free gift rather than involving
reciprocity, although it is supposed to be rewarded by merit through an impersonalprocess.Then,
moving from a formal analysis of the ethnography of religious donation (ahlu) to the contextual
analysisofthedifferentiatedusesofvariousformsofgivingincontemporaryBurma,the discussion
aims at highlighting differences with practices of ‘ritual offering’ (kadaw bwe) and ‘humanitarian
aid’(ke hse yay) showing how these different forms of interaction shape contrasted fields of
practice. The transaction occurring in religious donations then emerges as setting into motion a
crucialsocialprocess,theenactmentandreproductionofthedifferenceinstatusbetweenmonastics
and laypeople that is one of the main social processes contributing to the differentiation of a
Buddhist-defined‘religiousfield’.

(Pâli)2—the giving of wealth or food to sustain religious institutions—lies at the heart of
Buddhist life and actions. However, in the field of Buddhist studies, religious donations have

Inthe wake ofStanleyTambiah’snewperspectiveonTheravadaBuddhistsociologybased

the question of the transition of the early renouncer community to a national, political and
social Buddhism.Following on from the workby Carrithers (1979), he calls this question the
‘domestication’ of the Sangha3 and critiques the often prevalent idea that the domestication
of the Sangha has been its downfall. Strenski’s aim is rather to describe this process as shaping
the social fabric. In doing so, he decisively places the ‘gift’—understood as the Maussian gift
—at the core of his picture of the relationship that links monastics to the laity, phrasing his
argumentinthewordsofLévi-Strauss’stheoryofgeneralizedexchange.Indeed,inTheravadin

WiththemajorsocialpartitioninTheravadaBuddhistsocietiesopposingBuddhistmonastic
status to lay status, religious donations may indeed be regarded as a crucial process for society
itselfandforthesocialorder.Strenski’spaperhasthereforecontributedtoreorientingthethen
dominantWeberianperspectiveofviewingasdecaytheprocessoftransformationofthepristine
north-Indian groupsofwandererasceticsinto asociallyintegratedBuddhistcommunity.This
vision, prevalent at Strenski’s time, had originated in Buddhist communities as well as among
thefirstorientalistcommentators.
However,Strenski’suseoftheterm‘exchange’inthiscontextneedstobereexamined.One
weakness of his approach lies in the inappropriate way that he applied Lévi-Strauss’s theory
about groups exchanging women to the interactions between religious and lay people in a
Buddhist society.4 Juliane Schober has commented that ‘placing the samgha within the
exchange networks of lay society at large, as Strenski proposes, is mixing apples and oranges’
because ‘ordination into the samgha constitutes rebirth in another kind of existence’ (Schober
1989, 119). On the one hand, underlying this comment is the implicit premise that, because
of the vow of renunciation taken during the ordination process, a monk’s existence is not
subjecttosocialanalysisatall,apremisethatishardlysustainableasdemonstratedbytheauthor
herselfthroughoutmostofherwork.5Ontheotherhand,however,thequestionmayberaised
astowhetherLévi-Strauss’stheoryofexchangeaimedatunderstandingtheworkingsofsocial
groups based on the exchange of women adequately describes the distribution of social roles
betweenordainedmembersoftheSanghaandlaypeopleinaTheravadinsociety.
More to the point, what needs to be questioned here is the nature of the interaction that
servesasthebasisoftherelationship:Shouldthetransactionthatoccursinthecontextofare-
ligiousdonationbeanalyzedasanexchangeatall?Thispreviouslydebatedquestionneedstobe

contribution,‘Onthesociologyofprimitiveexchange’(Sahlins1972),hasbeenespeciallyuseful
inchallengingthereadilymadeequationbetweenexchangeandreciprocity.Sahlinsidentifies
reciprocity as one of two kinds of transaction present in primitive societies, together with
redistribution. He then analyzes reciprocity as a continuum depending on social distance and
oscillating between ‘generalized reciprocity’ or the one-way flow of goods between closely
related persons and ‘negative reciprocity’ between strangers, ‘balanced reciprocity’ being an
intermediate form that is only observed in a few cases. Pierre Bourdieu, for his part, has
highlightedtheimportanceofthelapseoftimethatseparatesthegiftfromitsreturnandwhich
serves to conceal the reciprocal nature of gift exchange (Bourdieu 1998). However, more
recently, Alain Testart (2007) and Florence Weber (2007) have argued for a more rigorous
use of terminology torestorethe common meaning of gift as‘freeof any obligation eitherto

In this paper, I suggest that the societal import of the Buddhist religious donation also
concerns the framing of ‘religion’asa separate field of practice and isconstitutiveof Buddhist
hegemony. More specifically, I propose to look at the religious donation in the Burmese
contextasoneofthesocialprocessescontributingtothedifferentiationofaBuddhist-defined

The way that Buddhist religious donation contributes to differentiating between various
fields of practice will be examined by analyzing transactions regarded as ‘religious’ and the

recipient or between laypeople and Buddhist institutions as a whole. In so doing, I translate
the Burmese expression ahlu that is a nominalization of the verb hlu-, meaning to give as a
Buddhist meritorious act,10 and I also intend to render the distinction made in Burmese
between this term and formulations for ‘ritual offering’ (kadaw bwe) and ‘humanitarian aid’
(kehseyay).Iregardthesedifferentformsof interactionashighlymeaningfulpracticesthathave

TheDebateConcerningtheBuddhistGiftinBurmeseStudies
Generallyspeaking,situating atthe coreofouranalysisinteractions thattake placeinthe reli-
giousfieldrepresentsadeparturefromtheapproachadoptedbyMelfordSpiro,afamousauthor
on Burmese Buddhism, whose main book: Buddhism and Society. A Great Tradition and Its
Burmese Vicissitudes (Spiro 1970), has become a work of reference although it has also been
criticized.Inthisbook,SpiroclassifiesBurmeseBuddhistreligiouspracticesandideasintothree
differentsystems.Thefirstofthesehelabelsnibbanic;heglossesitas‘purely’Buddhistbecauseit
isorientedtowardtheultimategoalof liberationfromsamsara,orthecycleof life,deathand
rebirth. The second, kammatic, is lower on this Buddhist scale because it is directed toward
mundane aims and dominated by the pursuit of merit, a kind of spiritual reward occurring
mainly through Buddhist religious donation. And the third he qualifies apotropaic to express
its motivations. The nibbanic and kammatic systems correspond to the archetypal roles of
monasticandlaypeoplerespectively,asideallyconceivedbytheBurmese.Spiro’sidentification
of a split in Buddhism and his interpretation of the kammatic system as a Burmese vicissitude
reveal his inclination toward Weber’s interpretation of Buddhism being on the decline.Spiro
insists that kammatic practices often imply orientations obverse to nibbanic ‘inwardness’, in
particular,meritoriousactionthatrepresentsaccordingtohiswords‘ageneralchangeinsoteri-
ologicalactionfrommeditation’(104).

they are, the relationship of interdependency on which monastic and lay paths depend at the
aggregate level implies no obvious reciprocity. Indeed, this subject is a question of debate.
Strenski, generalizing Tambiah’s statement, has popularized the view that in Theravada
Buddhism the monk is supposed to be a ‘paradigm of non-reciprocity’.11 In actual practice, a

ThereceivedBuddhisttheoryofmerit,whichisrecognizedinBurmaasinotherTheravadin
countries,holds thatthisrewardisinherent in theact of giving and thatmonksdonotreturn
anything. Monks merely represent the occasion for meritorious action, a fact encapsulated in
their common qualification as‘field ofmerit’.13Strenskithereforeneededtolook atreligious
donations from a broader perspective to show that these transactions are occasions for sharing
merit with a largercommunity of laypeoplethroughthe intermediacyofthemonk, tofoster
generalizedexchange.
Schober,whocarriedoutfieldresearcharoundMandalayinUpperBurmaatthebeginning
ofthe1980s,alsofocusedonexchangeinheranalysisofBuddhism.ArguingagainstStrenski’s
position, however, she clearly states that: ‘The necessary reciprocation of dâna through merit
constitutes the basis for Theravada Buddhist ritual exchange’ (Schober 1989, 113). Instead of
thegeneralizedexchangemodel,shesuggestsunderstandingtherelationshipbetweenamonk
and his donor asa case of restricted exchangein which the reciprocation of merit is indicated
by the merit-sharing ritual marking the closure of a primary exchange transaction (117–118).
G.Rozenberg(2004),whoexaminesgivingintheprocessesforproducingsainthoodinBurma,
insistsontheautomaticityofthereturnandarguesthattherelationshipestablishedthroughagift

For authors who situate the Theravadin religious donation within the framework of the
Maussian theoryofthe gift,reciprocitydepends firstandforemost on themeritthe laydonor

Thequestionofthereturnisindeedcomplex,giventhevarietyofformsreligiousdonations
take in a Theravadin context and the ubiquity of merit as a common reward in the different
cases.14 This is what appears implicitly when, examining the ritual procedures for giving,

‘ServingMonksRice’(Hsunkap-),theCoreoftheBuddhistReligiousDonation
Giving prepared food to monks during their daily alms rounds differs from other meritorious
occasions by the absence of ‘merit sharing’, the ritual through which good deeds are publicly
acknowledged. Nevertheless, almsgiving is considered to be the most accessible meritorious
occasioninBurmawhereitsperformanceispartofbehavioralethicsandbearsaspecificname

The lack of any religious service provided by the monks in return—precept, preaching or

It isworthnoting that, in ordertogenerate merit,a religious donation hastofulfill certain

thus goes to show the specificity of the interaction. To begin with, this framework is deter-
minedbyasetofmonasticrules.Themonks’ricehastobeservedatagiventime,beforenoon
because a monk will not eat any later, and presented with the appropriate items (i.e. no

Although simple, this framework allows for some variation in the way monks collect alms,
either individually or collectively, according to a planned or random route. Nonetheless, the
interaction between monastics and the laity during alms collection must always be extremely
sober.Moretothepoint,theremustbenoritualexpressionofmeritoriousresults.18Although

The framework for alms collection—clearly set to show that monks do not pointedly ask for

tion takes place between anonymous agents who belong to each of the two main statutory
groups constitutive of society without any personal relationship having to be established. In
otherwords,servingricetomonksisinkeepingwiththedefinitionofafreegift,oncondition
that it is performed in an impersonal context. However, through its character of public
non-reciprocity, the transaction sets into motion a crucial social process, the enactment and
reproduction of the difference in status between monastics and laypeople. Finally, daily alms
collection turns monks into mendicant renouncers and situates them in the Buddhist-defined
‘religious’domain.

these transactions for what they actually do; mark the difference as statutory through non-

MeritSharingasaMarkofReligiousDonations(Ahlu)
Onecharacteristicoftheinteractionplayedoutinalmsgivingandthatmarksitsdifferencefrom
other Buddhist religious donations is the absence of any merit dedication ritual. A dedication
ritual consists in declaring that a person shares the merit involved in the donation with all
sentient beings; this supposedly conditions the acquisition of merit by the lay donor in most
Buddhist religious transactions called ahlu. It serves to declare ritually20 that these actions of
givingtotheBuddhistreligion(thathana)aremeritoriousanddiscriminatethemfromtheother
ritualactionsencapsulatedintheBurmesecategoryof‘ritual’(pwe).

converselythelowlevelofritualizationinthecaseofalmsgiving,thesimplestkindofBuddhist
religious donation, althoughitmay be consideredasthe commonestoccasion for meritorious
action. In this sense, daily almsgiving may be regarded as a pure form of donation—which is
not even shown to be meritorious as if it were not needed to display this dimension of the
action.
In Burmese, merit sharing is called ‘water pouring’ (yay sek kya-) in accordance with the

Merit sharing is common in a variety of religious donations classed as ahlu. On these occa-
sions, whether private or public, collective or individual, donations may be dedicated to the
monastic order (thanga/P. sanghâ) or to various assets belonging to the Buddhist institution
(thathana/P. sâsana), such aspagodas or images of Buddha. These events may be conveniently
classified according to their location (the donor’s house, the monastery for novicehood, or
the pagoda) and to their temporality (exceptional occurrences like the building of a pagoda,

and sentient beings involved either to reciprocate the donation or to enter into a relation of
dependency with the main donor who is the master of the religious donation (ahlu shin).24
FollowingonfromKrisLehman’sstatementthat‘meritispower’,Schoberhasdulycontributed
to the understanding that religious donations create social obligations in the lay realm in the
form of spheres of power controlled by the main lay donor.25 This line of analysis regarding
theBuddhistgiftmayalsobeinkeepingwithauthorswhohavedevelopedasocialanalysisof
Buddhistreligioustransactionsintheconceptualframeworkofeconomiesofmerit.
Schober’sdistinctionbetweenprimaryexchangeandsecondaryexchangemayfurtherserve
to categorize meritorious occasions created by donations from the laity to monastics. In this
respect, almsgiving stands out from all other occasions because it only involves primary
exchange. Whereas almsgiving occurs in a framework characterized by anonymity, public
non-reciprocity and no disclosure of the spiritual rewards supposedly gained from laypeople’s
actions, other religious donations are entrenched in the laity’s social world and display merit
rewards through the dedication ritual. This display exemplifies the social dimension of merit
atthesametimeasitre-situatestheeventinthe‘religious’realm.
Afinaldistinctionbetweenalmsgivingandmorecomplexceremonialeventsisthattransac-
tions inthe formercasetake placebetween lay and religious realms and in the latter between
these realms and within the ‘secular’ world. In other words, there is a difference between the
‘religious’andthe‘non-religious’accordingtotheBuddhistBurmeseconception.26Onemight

Morecomplex interactions betweenlaypeopleand ordainedmembers of the Sangha com-
monly imply a more public mutual relationship than in the case of almsgiving. Nevertheless,
the donation is not reciprocated by the monks. They merely ensure the circulation of merit
aspassiverecipientsofthedonation.Meritcanhardlybetakenforreciprocationofthereligious

tothedonors.
In almsgiving and more complex religious donations, interactions between laypeople and
monastics do not therefore correspond to the definition of exchange as a bilateral transfer of
goods or services between two parties (Testart 2007). We have seen that the donations

are considered by Burmese Buddhists to be religious donations (ahlu). In this regard, the
religiousdonationframeworkofthesetransactionsmaybesaidtoconcealtheservicedimension
of monks’ role.27 At the ideological level, making donations to maintain religious institutions
(thathana) appears as a lay practice in which free gifts are offered, with no obligation to
reciprocate on the part of monks, even though they may initiate complex social relationships
and define fields of power in the social world.28 Laypeople continue to generate merit with
an allegedly karmic benefit and possibly tangible social results through specifically oriented
donations—renouncing wealth in order to maintain the religious institutions and to preserve
Buddhistteachings.Theserviceperformedbythemonksforthelaycommunitiesareconcealed

of as an embodiment of these teachings. Religious donations effectively enact the statutory
distinction between ordained members of the Sangha and laypeople, thus contributing to the
differentiationof a highly valued Buddhist-defined‘religious’ domainasseparate from the lay
domain.
Gift-GivingPracticesVersusReligiousDonations
Religious donations thus function to set boundaries that serve to discriminate between
‘paths’ (lam) or ways to be taken to reach salvation from the life cycle (thandaya/P.
samsarâ), according to the Buddhist model. Different paths may be followed according
to one’s karmic status. According to the Burmese point of view, monks, for example,
attaintheirhighstatusor‘religious’statusthankstotheirkarmicachievementsinpreviouslives.
Laymen,ontheotherhand,remainlaypeoplebecauseoftheirownkarma.Thus,accordingto
thisview,themonasticwayof lifeisnotprimarilyamatterofchoicebutofkarma.
As regards gift-giving practices, other contrasted paths may be identified in the Burmese
social world, namely, spirit possession, esotericism, and humanitarianism. To follow one path
means to belong to a particular network of specialists, practitioners, or devotees, to share the
same conceptions of the world and to ignore the others, with in principle no passage from
one to the other. Looking at gift-giving practices in paths located at the periphery of the
Buddhist-defined ‘religious’ field will allow us to contrast these practices with religious
donationsandtohighlighttheirrelativespecificities.
More specifically, to ‘give to religious institutions’ (hlu-) is different from ‘presenting ritual
offerings’ (kadaw bwe sek-) to spirits belonging to the Burmese pantheon of Thirty-Seven
Lords.29Kadaw referstothe tributethatlocalchiefs and princes used topaytoBurmese kings
when kingship still existed. In the contemporary language, it designates every expression of
respect to high-ranking beings (whether spirits, parents, teachers, elders, or even monks) and
could be translated as ‘paying homage’. Kadaw bwe is used for standard offerings consisting
mainlyofcoconutandbanana,placedonaplateandmadetopayhomagetosuchhigh-ranking
beings.Ritualofferingsmadetospirits(kadawbwesek-)aredeterminedbypreviouslyestablished
relationships and the donor receives protection in return, hence these transactions may be
regarded asexchanges.Duringspiritpossession séances, the protectiongranted bythespirit in
return for the devotees’ kadaw bwe offerings, to which various goods and money are added, is
materialized by the redistribution of part of the offerings, which are then considered to be
loadedwiththe‘power’(tago)ofspiritualagency.

buylotteryticketsatsomepointinthefuture.Thesweatofthepossessedmediummakesthe
bank notes special. Any money won using these notes is then considered to be the result of
the spirit’s benevolence. The devotee is therefore indebted to the spirit, who becomes his
‘master of debt’ (kyayzu shin). Finally, any wealth that is offered to the spirit is considered to
be an investment, any return on which is considered as granted by the spirit and benefits the

rulers, the SLORC and the SPDC,31 drew heavily between 1990 and 2007 is particularly
important in my eyes. This multifaceted policy had built both on the embellishment and the

Since then, charitable work has provided Burmese laypeople and monks with opportunities to

ReligiousStatus,ReformandSocialActivism
The case of the abbot Udu Mingala exemplifies the potentiality for social action that charity
represents for monastics in a period of intense competition for religious donations as a
resource.33 In an interview at his monastery North of Yangon, in November 2011, Udu
Mingala explained to me that his aim was to preach Buddhist truths to the greatest number
ofpeopleandtocopewithwhathesawasthe‘destructionofreligion’(thathanapyek)forwhich

The esoteric field of practice is complex because it encompasses various isolated types of
itinerant ascetics, groups of devotees whose leaders claim to have direct access to a weikza
(mainly Bo Min Gaung) depending on the weikza medium’s charisma, as well as structured
congregations of exorcists amounting to thousands of members. Interestingly enough, weikza

they often undergo an ‘initiation’ ritual called ‘to take knowledge’ (pinnya yu-), which consists
in a ritual tattoo of ‘medicine’ (hsay) supposedly produced by weikza. Patients are also asked to
renounce any devotion to traditional spirits. Exorcists go to their patient’s houses to ‘clean’ all
thespirits.Whenaskedabouttheirattitudetowardthespirits,themastersofthesecongregations
reply that they are not against the spirits but that weikza medicine is stronger than a spirit’s

With regard to the pervading idea of weikza ‘rescuing’ (ke-) Buddhism in the world, and
particularly Buddhism in Burma, it is worthwhile noting the position of cult group leaders
regardingreligiousdonations(ahlu).Intheinteractionwiththeirfollowers,thereisnoquestion
at all of religious donations (ahlu). This is coherent with the fact that the esoteric field is a lay
field and that alms collection is a prerogative of monastics. Although leaders of weikza cult

to ‘ritual offerings’ (kadaw bwe) made to the spirits or other high-ranking beings, they differ
essentially in the way the payment is made to look impersonal. Not only is it undertaken in
all transparency but it is also performed almost inconspicuously, egalitarian in spirit, avoiding
any ostentation, not addressed to the healer, nor claimed by the weikza through possession.
In other words, what distinguishes weikza path specialists from those of the spirit cult is they
refrain from requesting any ritual offerings and, instead, assert a discourse about rescuing the
world.
Finally,weikzaspecialistsdistinguishthemselvesfromcontiguousBuddhistdefined‘religious’
fieldandspiritritualfieldbythefactthattheyarenotvalidrecipientsofreligiousdonationsand
do not openly ask for ritual offerings through possession by a spiritual agent or otherwise.

Helping people progress in the lay world along the karmic path is the general objective of
weikza-path adepts. This brings to mind the bodhisattva figures of the Mahayana branch of
Buddhism, although no historical link can be proven. What is of interest here is that this weikza

*Nat is the Burmese word for spirits.
While spirit (nat) worship, in the middle column, appears to be a transactional framework
design for intense exchanges, this table clearly shows that this is not the case in the monastic
and the weikza fields, since they have both reversed one-way transaction frameworks. On
theotherhand,thetransferofgoodstoweikzaspecialistsortospiritmediumsproducesareturn

Atthis level of analysis, exchangemodels do not succeedinportraying the socialimportof

donationsmaybeofmajoreconomicimportance,farfrominitiatinganexchange,theycontri-
butetothedailysettingofboundariesbetweenwhatis‘religious’andwhatisnot,accordingto
the Burmese Buddhist view. Monks’ passive receipt of donations contributes to their higher
‘religious’ statusand ensuresthehegemonicposition of Buddhism withinthe whole Burmese
religiousfield.

religion when examined from a broader analytical perspective, the kind of interaction that
religious donations generate looks unique and contributes in this way to the hegemony of
theBurmeseBuddhist-defined‘religious’fieldofpractice(thathana).

religious institutions (thathana) or ordered monastics (thangha), the Pâli dâna refers also to the Buddhist religious
donation but is mainly used at a higher ‘religious’ level of speech. A Burmanized combination of the two words
ahludan exists and refers to the general practice of religious giving. Significantly, the uses of ahlu and dâna to refer to

18 Thisanalysisoftheformalframeworkdoesnotprecludethepossibilityofmorepersonalizedrelationsoftendeveloping

observes in this regard a difference between rural and contemporary urban settings (Kawanami 2013, 154). See also

20 WhilemeritisindeedcentraltoreligiousdonationsinBurmaasinotherTheravadinpolities,theaccentintheahlu
categorizationisontheactofgivingtotheBuddhist‘religion’(thathana).Bycontrast,inThailand,meritoriousoccasions
are literally called to ‘make merit’ (tham bun, Thai) (Tambiah 1970 and Bowie 1998), laying emphasis on the reward
expectedbythedonors.
21 TheprimarymeaningoftayainBurmeseis‘law’,anditisusedmorespecificallyfor‘Buddhistteachings’,whichcorresponds

22 OnthedevelopmentofpublicpreachinginSriLankaanditsimplications,seeDeegalle(2006).
23 Other expressions that pertain to different speech levels designate the lay donor of a religious donation. Dâyakâ is
the Buddhist Pâli word for lay donor that monks commonly use. Schober (1989) refers mainly to kutho shin
meaning the master of merit (from the Pâli kusâla), an expression that is not common in the Lower Burma contexts
I have come across.

25 In fact, this opposition between ‘religious’ and ‘non-religious’ fields of action has its equivalent in the Pâli
terminology the Burmese use to oppose ‘in-this-world’ (lawkîya) to ‘out-of-this–world’ (lokuttarâ). A rough equivalent
would be the religious/secular opposition inasmuch as the differentiation of a ‘religious domain’ within society
pertains to the complementary process of secularization. However, in Burma, the ‘non-religious’ or mundane domain
isindeeddifferent from the Western notionofsecularity.
