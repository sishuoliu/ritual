DEREGULATING RELIGION: THE ECONOMICS
OF CHURCH AND STATE
LAURENCE R. IANNACCONE, ROGER FINKE, and RODNEY STARK*
Traditional religious research fails to recognize religion as a market phenome-
non. It especially overlooh supply-side factors that shape the incentives and op-
portunities of religious prms, emphasizing instead demand-side shifts in the
perceptions, tastes, and needs of consumers. This paper reviews the eflects of
government actions that alter religious supply. Our examples demonstrate that
simple deregulation lies at the root of major religious trends and that the vitality
of a religious market depends critically upon its competitiveness. (JEL L5 1)
