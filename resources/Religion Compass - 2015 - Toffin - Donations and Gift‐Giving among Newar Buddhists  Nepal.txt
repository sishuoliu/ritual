These issues, both in Hindu and Buddhist society, clearly touch upon the core of the social

actions that can be hidden or performed in a spectacular way. They help to hold together the
different elements of society and are crucial for the reproduction of the group. With no giving
and receiving, social links between the different segments of the community would be much
looser, and the magnificent statues, paintings and temples of the ancient Newar civilization of
Nepal(amongmanyotherIndic civilizations)mightnever have existed.Thekey elementhere
isthat,moresignificantly,gift-givingpatternsfalloutsidethemarketeconomy.Theybelongto
non-mercantile forms of wealth distribution and are beyond the utilitarian sphere of activities.
The ‘spirit of the gift’ derives its strength from the negation of mercantile and market systems
oftransactions(Toffin2014).Iarguethat,inalargepartofSouthAsiaandtheHimalayas,thegift

Participants were all volunteers, and blood giving was carried out on purely altruistic, moral

remarkable. This is particularly obvious if we adopt a comprehensive view of such large

thiscontextarecalleddāna(Sanskrit),dāninHindiandNepali,whichisthesamewordthatis
usedtodesignatethevariousformsofdonationinHinduandotherBuddhistcontexts.2Thisis
a complex issue even in the relatively small Newar Buddhist community of the Kathmandu
Valley on the southern flank of the Himalayas, which constitutes a community of approxi-
mately 400,000 to 500,000 followers. It is complex because current Newar Buddhism lies
at the crossroads between Indic and Southeast Asian Buddhism (without forgetting the
SriLankanTheravādaschool).Iintendtoshednewlightonsuchtransactionsamongthisgroup;
a topic that, I believe, has so far been dealt with rather superficially and has not been fully
understood.Icontend,amongotherthings,thatinadditiontotheirtranscendentalscope,gifts
reinforcethesocialidentitiesofboththelaityandmonks/priests.
SinceNewarBuddhismisincreasinglymadeupoftwodifferentcurrents,Mahāyāna/Vajrayāna
ontheonehandandTheravādaontheotherhand,Iwillcompareandcontrasttwogift-giving
ceremonies: (a) Pañca Dāna, or Pãjādã, which belongs to the old form of Newar Buddhism
based chiefly on the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna schools (Indic Buddhism); and (b) Kathina
Dāna,animportantceremonyinTheravādaBuddhism(SoutheastAsianBuddhism),amove-
mentrecentlyintroducedinNepalandrapidlyexpandingamongNewarsoftheKathmandu
Valley(formerlyknownastheNepalValley).TheravādaisinfactattestedduringtheLicchavi
period (fifth–eighth centuries), but it felt in decay afterwards. These two ritual events are
performed by this Newar ethnic population, in most cases by the very same persons and
families but at different times. The first is a regular ritual that takes place every year during
therainyseason,atadatefixedbythelunarcalendar(insomecases,itmayalsobeanoptional
gift ceremony sponsored by a layman on other occasions). The second (Kathina) is purely
optional and is organized at the end of the rainy season, in October or November. I have
attended both ceremonies over the years (and the first one fairly regularly since the 1970s)
inLalitpur(Patan).Commonfeaturesanddissimilaritiesbetweentheseeventswillbeemphasized,
andgeneralissuesregardinggiftswillbeaddressed.
Myaimistwofold.First,Iintendtoscrutinizethemeaningofthesetwocomplexrituals,their
spiritualdimension,therationalebehindtheflowsofvariousgoodsandthemoneythatisdis-
tributed on these occasions. Gift-giving is a highly religious act both in Buddhist and Hindu
society. It has its own semantics that need to be studied in depth. It will become clear in the
followingthatthedānaamongNewarBuddhists,aswellasamongmostofSouthAsianHindu
communities,isinconsistentwiththeexchangemodeloutlinedbyMarcelMaussinhisfamous
essay(1925).Thereisno obligationtoreciprocateortorepaywithacounter-gift.The merit,
punya, which the donor can expect in return for his generosity towards monks/priests, is
regardedasindirect,non-systematic.AccordingtoNewarBuddhists,dānasarefirstofalldona-
tionsandofferings.TheyarereluctanttotranslatetheIndieworddānabygiftbecause,forthem,
this word has mainly a secular meaning. Here we are faced with a specific pattern based on
different ethics and formulated in its own particular way. Second, my purpose is to stress the
sociological impact of these unreciprocated gifts. I will try to show that the donations given
duringPañcaDānaandKathinaDānabindtogethertheBuddhistlaityandtheirpractitioners,
whether priests or symbolic monks, as during the first event, or real monks, as in the second.
These links combine hierarchical and egalitarian socio-religious values. They single out the
NewarBuddhistcommunityfromtherestoftheNewarpopulation,whichisHindu.
Methodologically, my analysis is based on three different sources of information: (a) the
canonical discourse, derived from religious and moral texts; these sacred scriptures are known
mainlytopriests/monksand aredisseminatedamong the population by preaching,thepublic
readingofstoriesortherecitationofsacredtexts;(b)ethnographicobservationsofreligiousactivities,
what people do in concrete terms, which often contradicts canonical statements; and (c) local
people’s discourse, the explanations they give for attending these events, how they see them

operate to the exclusion of one another. In practical terms, it is not an easy task for the social
scientisttocombinethesesources.Contradictionsoftenemergeevenatthesamelevel(between

community’s ritual needs, some of them specializing in textual study, medicine, astrology
and meditation. They are empowered to perform homa fire sacrifices and Tantric rituals and
to ordain priests. They have their own clients, such as Hindu purohita Brāhmin priests. In this
capacity, there are referred to as guruju in Newari. Yet only a small number of them perform

Vajrāchāryas and Shākyas are the recipients of gifts given by Buddhist laypersons, called
upāsaka in Sanskrit, and Urāy (or Udās) in Newari. This laity, consisting mainly of traders
and craftsmen, live mostly in former Malla capital cities (Kathmandu, Lalitpur/Patan
and Bhaktapur). In addition, Jyāpu farmers (the biggestNewar caste)dwellingin these three
historicalcitiesaswellasinvillageareasarealsotraditionallyBuddhist,exceptintheBhaktapur
area, a former kingdom that was greatly influenced historically by Hinduism. The laity call
upon Vajrāchārya priests, guruju, during their main domestic rituals, such as marriage and
funerals.
IncontrasttomainstreamTibetanreligion,thisNewarBuddhismisbasedonSanskritlitur-
gicaltexts.ItisdirectlyrelatedtoBuddhistpracticesandbeliefsthatexistedinNorthernIndia
until the 12th–14th centuries. A large numberof Indian monks took refuge with their books
intheKathmanduValleyatthattime.ThefresharrivalofBuddhistrefugeesplayedaconsider-
able role in the development of Newar civilization as a whole. It had a huge impact on the
developmentofthelocalculture,inallfieldsofart(sculpture,paintingandarchitecture),aswell
asonitslinkswithTibet.Today,nearlyallBuddhisttextswritteninSanskritcomefromNepal.
As a living tradition, Mahāyāna Buddhism based on Sanskrit texts has only survived in the
Kathmandu Valley. In this field, as in many others, the Nepal Valley has preserved cultural
aspectsthatdiedoutlongagoinIndia.However,onefeatureofNewarBuddhismisthehuge
influenceHinduismhashadonit.Duringthemiddleages,HinduMallakingsruledoverthe
Nepal Valley and the Mahāyāna community lived in a Hindu-dominant environment. Over
theyears,Shaivism(mainlyShaivaTantra)hasgainedmoreandmoreimportance.Besides,local
devotees were isolated from substantive external Buddhist influences for many centuries.
Admittedly, some elements of this accommodation process have their roots in Indian devel-
opment. Yet there has been a subsequent acceleration in changes in Hindu Nepal. To take
just two examples: Shākyas practise the Hindu kanyā dāna, ‘gift of the bride’ during the
wedding; and the burā jãku old-age celebration for elders who reach the ripe old age of
77, includes making a Brāhman the gift of a cow (go dāna), as part of an otherwise Vajrayāna
ritual ceremony (Lewis 1993: 349). One result of this development is that Buddhism has
merged with elements of Hinduism. By and large, Newar Buddhists have tended to adopt a
numberofgodsandregulationsmoreinkeepingwithHinduismthanwithBuddhism.Quite
surprisingly, Newar Buddhist society has embraced the caste system and the notion of ritual
purityassociatedwithit.IthasevencopiedanumberofHindu‘institutions’suchastherelation-

In recent decades, Theravāda Buddhism has spread among the Newars of the Kathmandu

DonationsandGift-GivingamongNewarBuddhists,Nepal 429
A number of traditional Newar Buddhists have been attracted by this more orthodox,
authentic, non-ritualistic form of religion, as compared with traditional Vajrayāna Buddhism,
itsnon-vegetariandietanditsstrictethicsthatsometimesbearsacloseresemblancetoProtestantism
initsoppositiontoCatholicism(whichcanbeseenasnearertoIndicNewarBuddhism).Theravāda
particularly spurns frequentfeasting which includesthe religiously sanctioned useof meatand
alcohol during Vajrayāna tantric rituals. For practitioners, the ordination of monks replaces
theVajrayānadīkshāinitiation.Theravādapracticesandbeliefsprovidefollowerswithasupplement
in matters of virtue, donation and transcendental aims to the ordinary, old Indic religion of
Buddhist Newars.
Today, traditional NewarBuddhism isunquestionablyon thedecline (LeVine and Gellner
2005: 37). The conversion movement to Theravāda Buddhism has reached out to middle-
and lower-ranking Newar castes, like Maharjan (Jyāpu) agriculturists or some occupational
castes such as Mānandhars (oil-pressers) who have come to regard the old Vajrayāna religion
asbeing corrupted by Hindu superstitious beliefs and practices.SomeNewarsbecomemonks
(bhikshu) or nuns (anāgārikā) and build Theravādin monasteries. Others simply support
renouncersthroughdonationsandattendpublicsermonsbeforeenshrinedimagesofBuddha,
as well as some rituals. By adopting Theravāda, these Newars wish to reform and revive
Buddhismintheirculture.Yet,strikinglyenough,theyhavenottotallygivenupoldBuddhist
beliefs and practices. The majority of them still partake in the old tantric Vajrayāna religion,
especially as far as life-cycle rituals are concerned. This coexistence frequently creates tension
andrivalrybetweenTheravādinbhanteandVajrāchāryaguruju.

Vajrāchāryas chant Sanskrit verses in honour of their donors (dāta) while receiving gifts/alms
(Gellner 1992: 187–188). The most well-known verse is: parābhawantu sadā sukhī āyu āroge

taleassertsthatagroupof30monkswasjourneyingtogetherinIndiatotheplacewhereLord
Buddha lived. Unfortunately, heavy monsoon rains forced them to make a stop before they
were able to reach their destination. Their robes had become drenched and muddy. They
finally arrived at Shākayamuni’s dwelling-place and were welcomed wholeheartedly by him.

Today this gift-giving ceremony is widely practised in Buddhist Theravādin countries:
Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, etc. Lay supporters continue to follow this tradition at the end
of the three-month rainy season (Skt. varsāvāsa, Pāli vassa) during which samgha members go
on a spiritual retreat. In fact, the donation of the robe marks the end of the monks’ three-
month retreat; it is held in the fourth month of the rainy season. The cloth, about three
metres long (sometimes the clothes), which must be as beautiful as possible, has to be offered
tothewholesamghacommunity,whichwillthendecideamongthemselveswhoistoreceive

For at least three or four decades, Kathina Dāna has been regularly celebrated by Newar
Buddhist families according to Theravāda practices and beliefs. The donation ceremony is
always organized on the ground floor of a vihāra monastery and may be sponsored by just
one household of devotees or jointly by several families. I attended one such ceremony on
October 24, 2013 (7 Kartik 2070), six days after the full moon of the lunar month of Kārtik
(October–November), at Sumangal Vihāra (Lumkhusi), not very far from Uku Bāhāl, in the
south of the city of Patan. About six bhante monks were gathered on a stage, presiding over

understoodthat,justasatKathinaceremoniesperformedinotherBuddhistcountries,thefinal

The ceremony ends with the monks giving the audience a blessing (suvā in Newari). This
benediction takes the form of monks chanting Buddhist sutra (about bringing ‘relief from
distress’ in particular). Afterwards, food (boiled rice, cooked vegetables, fruit) and soft drinks
are handed out to everybody (this food is not distributed if Kathina is celebrated in
the afternoon). It is believed that the Kathina ceremony generates merit or both the donors
and attendees of the ceremony. Devotees therefore try to attend for as long as possible, even
if they are not directly involved in the ceremony. By and large, Kathina is known to be a

Normally, onlya monastic robe is given. However, thisgift can be accompanied by dona-

offered every monthofthe year, contrary to Kathina,are made only to fullyordained bhiksus
(upasampadā).7Whateverthe casemaybe,donationsmustbe given toa Buddhistcommunity

It is worth noting that, according to Theravāda beliefs, Kathina is the first in a list of eight
great donations that can be made to the Buddhist community (samgha), mahā punya karma,
and which the samgha expect from the laity. The list includes: (1) Kathina, (2) Ashta Pariskar

During Kathina, nuns are excluded from donations. During Pañcadān, the situation becomes

most of the gifts are edible, including the grain, food is taken home where anybody can
eat it. Sometimes, at peoples’ houses, dāna also includes food that has to be eaten on the

Remarkably, Shākyas are treated as monks even though they are in fact householders and
have no religious function in society (save some rare exceptions in the bāhāh for worshipping
Buddhist deities). Today their sacred status derives mainly from a mock ceremony that is
performed during their childhood (bare chuigu) and from their belonging to their respective
bāhāhwhichstillkeepsaliveaBuddhist-specifichistoryandwhichhousesanumberofBuddha,

(monk) status, and no longer act or perform their ancient role in daily life. Such disjunction
and its persistence over the years are puzzling phenomena which studies of Newar Buddhism

DonationsandGift-GivingamongNewarBuddhists,Nepal 435
In this Mahāyāna/Vajrayāna event, interest and disinterest are in fact combined. In stark
contrast,thesetypesofofferingsareabsentfromKathina,inkeepingwiththeTheravādarejection
ofmyriadsofMahāyānaBuddhistdeities.11
AreTheseGiftsReciprocated?
Buddhist texts are clear about donation: gifts from the laity to monks are supposed to be
unreciprocatedandunconditionaldonations.Theyaresaidtobetotallygratuitous.Thehighest
gift,itissaid,isgivenwithoutexpectinganyrewardfromtherecipient.Theoretically,thereis

recipient(idem2005:108).AgiftofamonasticrobeduringKathinaisadisinterestedgift.The
donator does not expect a ‘thank you’ from the donee. Indian Buddhist narrative literature is
replete with stories about edifying acts of generosity in which a human character or even an
animal gives away parts of his body to whoever makes the request.13 These virtuous values
associated with the gift are extremely theorized and valued in the Indian Buddhist textual
discourse,bothaccordingtotheVajrayānaandtheTheravādaschools.Therulesandteachings
about gifts (Skt. dānadharma) are among the highest moral conceptions. They are part of the
upmostBuddhistvalues and are endlessly recited duringJātaka storytelling and preaching.Ifa
giftisreciprocated,itisofverylowvalue.
Byandlarge,myethnographicobservationscorroboratetheseprecepts.Noneofthedona-
tions mentioned above are viewed as remunerations for religious services. All my Newar
Buddhist informants stress that pure generosity in matters of donation is the expected mode
of behaviour. In giving alms and other items to monks, Buddhist devotees mainly honour
and prize the monks in proportion to the transcendental values they embody. Monks rank
aboveallhumanbeings,evenkingsandpoliticalleaders.Theydonotneedtoreciprocatethe
salutation, pranam or namaskār, bestowed on them by anyone. Monks/priests are pervaded by
an aura of sacredness. The more you give to monks and monasteries, the better you will
become. Donations help to develop spiritual qualities and to destroy selfish elements and
acquisitiveimpulsesthatultimatelyleadtofurthersuffering.Theyareinstrumentsofsalvation.
Gift-giving implies renunciation (Sanskrit: tyāga) and to some extent self-sacrifice. The

However,itisdifficulttoreachastateofpuregenerositywithnosubsequentcompensation

withanexpectationofreturnmustbeeuphemized,sothattheself-interestedindividualpursuit

Nonetheless,PañcaDānaalsoinvolvesagreatdealofreciprocityinthegift-givingprocedure
amongShākyasandVajrachāryas.Thesetwocategoriesofpeoplemutuallypresentthemselves
withgiftsaswithneighboursandstrangers.GubhājusandBarejuseithersitinrowsinbāhāhto
receive alms or the donors sit in rows and the recipients walk from one to another chanting
verseswhiletheyreceivegifts.Inotherwords,ShākyasandVajrachāryasbothgiveandreceive
dān in a reciprocal pattern of gifts and counter-gifts. In most bāhāhs, women form a line and
donate money, rice, etc. Nobody asks whether they are gubhāju or bareju. They may also go
to someone’s house (a Newar Buddhist house) to receive alms. The result is a puzzling
widespreadcircleofreciprocateddonationsaccordingtoasetofunwrittenrules.
In addition, as in the Hindu religion, the merits obtained from gift-giving on ceremonial
Buddhistoccasionsaretransferablebythepunyamodana(Skt.)procedure.Thisisapurelymental
technique. By this means, a person can transfer part of the merit earned (by giving a gift) to
somebodybelongingtooneofthreefollowingcategoriesofbeings:gods,devata;livingbeings,
satva; and beings living in the world-in-between, bhuta-preta. In Sanskrit, modana means:
‘gratifying’, ‘gladdening’. Even if it is worded in purely religious terms, such transferability
andredistributionofthevirtueofagiftconfersonthemeritamechanicalcharacterpertaining
more to the secular realm than to the spiritual world. Obviously, the language of charity is
complexandinvolvesmanylevelsofmeaning.
HierarchyandEquality
Buddhismissaidtobeareligionofbrotherhoodandequality,especiallyinitsmodernistavatar.
However,asintheHinduworld,wherehypergamicmarriage,kanyādān,goesfromwife-giver
to wife-taker, or where a dāna prestation goes to a high-ranking priest in exchange for ritual
services, in Buddhism the links between the giver and the recipient are mostly asymmetrical.
By and large, in religious practices, a gift that passes in the opposite direction, downwards
toward unworthy donees, generates very little merit (Ohnuma 2005: 114). A gift given toan
immoralpersonbearslittlefruit.14
Similarly, in the two Newar Buddhist ceremonies concerned, gifts clearly go from
low-ranking persons to worthy recipients; they are directed upwards to superior recipients
(monks, priests). During Kathina ceremonies, monks stand above everything else. Devotees
stand in a respectful position during their gift-giving (by taking off their shoes for instance).
They venerate monks and sometimes lie prostratebefore them prior toor after their blessing.
Theseritualproceduressurroundingthetransferofgoodsorediblesareallegedlyasimportant
asthe giftitself.A similarhierarchy prevails during PañcaDāna:duringthe ceremony, theāju
elders of the bāhāh, who are the most valued recipients of gifts, stand at the top of the local
hierarchy and are treated respectfully.A personhas tobowdownbeforethemwhen giving a

Gifts hence express the superiority of religious transcendental values (Skt: dharma or
lokottara) in relation to secular, ‘worldly’ ones (Skt: laukika). They articulate the higher posi-
tion of religious persons over laymen in the hierarchy. Theravāda monks are dependent on
gifts for their livelihood (contrary to Shākyas and Vajrāchāryas), but they stand on a different
plane, in opposition to the mundane world of non-monastic families. Among Newars, this
distinction is more apparent in a Theravāda context than in a Mahāyāna one, since ascetic
monks live separate from the laity, whereas Vajrāchāryas and Shākyas are more this-worldly

orientated and less disconnected from the rest of the Buddhist community, especially when
they live outside bāhāh, which is more and more common nowadays. Their close contact
with the rest of the population is accentuated by their regular participation in their clients’
life-cycle rituals.
Theissueofequality,however,issometimesraised,especiallyinIndicBuddhism,whichhas
beeninfluencedbythecastesystemandHinduvalues.Forinstance,offeringkhīr(ricepudding;
Skt. ksīra) to Shākyas and Vajrāchāryas during Pañca Dāna is essential. The reason given by
NewarhouseholdersforpresentingthisdishisthattheyareimitatingSujāta,thewomanwho
gave khīr to Buddha on the eve of his enlightenment. The food is served on a leaf plate. If
the offering comes fromotherShākyas and Vajrāchāryas,thereisno problem. Butif itcomes
fromUrāys,alowergroupaccordingtoVajrāchāryapriests,andwithwhommarriageisforbid-
den,theacceptanceofcookedricemaycausedifficulties(Rosser1964,Lewis1993:337).For
Urāys, the acceptance of this cooked gift is important since it signifies social equality with
Vajrāchāryas. Yet, at the beginning of the 20th century, during the Rana period, a quarrel
opposed Vajrāchāryasand Urāysoverthis particular question. Suddenly, Vajrāchāryasdecided
to be stricter with their lay patrons and to refuse to eat boiled rice in their houses after
performingritualsforthem.TheyclaimedthatUrāysacceptedprasādleftoversfromaTibetan
lamawithwhomtheywereincontact.ForVajrāchāryas,acceptingprasādfromthesereligious
priests was (and still is) synonymous with losing one’s caste. The issue is contentious even
today, although the tendency is towards a more egalitarian relationship. Let us bear in mind
in this respect that traditional Newar Buddhism restricts the highest salvific practice to the
elite(i.e.highcastes),whereasitistheoreticallyopentoanybodyinitsTheravādacounterpart
(LeVine and Gellner 2005: 35).
Furthermore,duringKathinaaswellasduringotherTheravādacelebrations,themonks’so-

tion to the large number of Nāy Butchers in the audience and among donors, if one of the
monks associated with the vihāra comes from a Nāy family. They admit this yet somewhat
reluctantly. During the first decades in which Theravāda spread throughout the Kathmandu
Valley, some upper-caste monks were hesitant to accept rice from low-caste householders,
contrary to Buddhist principles. Upper-caste laypeople were opposed to monks accepting
boiledriceasalms from casteslower thantheir own(LeVineand Gellner2005: 63).Afterall,
the Buddhist Newar élite still bars access to their bāhāh to untouchable castes (Pode sweepers

gift’, meaning that the bodhisattva is humble while giving and does not give for the sake of
rivalry with others (Ohnuma 2005, 120). In these two cases, we obviously come up against
differentvaluesandcontrastinglanguagesassociatedwithgifts.
Mypointisthatgifteconomiesandgiftpatternscoveralargenumberofcontextsandmany

messages. The formittakesvariesgreatly depending onthe particular culturewithinwhich it

paradigmaticinthisconcern.IndiscussingdānainHinduandBuddhistcontexts,weareindeed
very far from the Kwakiutl (and the more reciprocal Maori) models of gifts and counter-gifts
discussed by Marcel Mauss. Different forms of donation economies exist. Even alms-giving
canbesubjectedtomeaningfulvariations.17
Therecannotthereforebeasingletheoryofthegift,butaseriesofvariationsonthistheme.
The very evidence of this statement is the inappropriateness of Marcel Mauss’s famous essay
(1925)—the necessarily reciprocal definition of all gifts— for understanding the Indian dāna,
whether in a Hindu or Buddhist framework. It is an established fact that the Indian form of
religious gift must not be reciprocated. Contrary to Mauss’s statement, there is no exchange
init.ThepresentessayonNewargiftsclearlycorroboratesthisassertion,withslightdifferences.
Whatever the case may be, it is worthwhile to stress some sociological facts derived from
directethnographicobservation.LetusconsiderSamyakMahādāna,anothersumptuoustradi-
tional Newar Buddhist alms-giving ceremony, performed at a regular date, every four or 12
yearsdependingonthecitywhereittakesplace.ThemostsignificantcontrastbetweenPañca
Dāna and Samyak is that the latter is a more collective ceremony, organized for the whole
samgha. Furthermore, Samyak is closely associated with Dīpankara worship. I attended this
splendid and costly ceremony in 2001 in Nāg Bāhāl, an old and prominent Mahāyāna bāhāh
in Lalitpur. I contend that this performance is infused with dominant this-worldly rules and
ideologies.Itincludes,forinstance,ostensible,competitiveandlavishdonations.Furthermore,

Conclusions
In this article, I have tried to highlight the pluralistic realm of Newar Buddhism in matters
of gift-giving and the social patterns of giving and receiving in this particular Nepalese
ethnic group.18 It is obvious that among Newars, as in most Southeast Asian communities,
acts of generosity play an all-important role in Buddhist ceremonies. One useful conclusion
to my account is therefore that gift-giving is one of the key religious values of Newar
society and prevails in whole areas of transactions, at the junction between the social and
the sacred. Yet, the ritual language differs greatly if the donation is carried out in a
Theravāda or in a traditional Indic Mahāyāna/Vajrayāna religious background. I have thus
demonstrated that during Kathina, gifts are expressed in a manner that is much more op-
tional, and individualistic as well as less connected to the caste system than during Pañca
Dāna. These contrastive features all together constitute the religious field of Newar Buddhist
religion.Asfarasreciprocityisconcerned,allthesegiftscombinedominantnonreciprocalfeatures
andsomeminimalformsofreturn(merit,prestige,wealth).Itisdifficulttoconsideragiftwithout
anyexpectedcompensationorreturn.
The ethnographical and anthropological analyses of these two gift-giving Newar Buddhist
ceremonies, examined both independently and with respect to their mutual links, lead me to
make three remarks. Firstly, Buddhist institutions, whether Mahāyānist or Therāvadin, have
beendomesticatedherebylocalvaluesandadaptedtoNewarcommunalformsofsocialbond-
ing. In most cases, donors and donees act as members of a social group rather than as isolated
individuals.PañcaandKathinaDāna,forinstance,enhanceNewaridentity.Asamatteroffact,
participantsinthesetwoalms-givingceremoniesareNewarsandonlyNewars—incontradiction
totheuniversalisticmessageoforiginalBuddhism.Religionhasbeenparticularized,ethnicized
and transformed in collective ethnic rituals. Such social aspects must not be forgotten while
studying rituals and donations. I contend that in both cases, even during Kathina Dāna, the
spirit of the gift is the expression of holistic social values in which the individual is subordi-
nated to the group and excessive accumulation of wealth is refrained by the obligation of
generosity.
Secondly,bythesametoken,itmustbenotedthatNewarBuddhistgift-givingceremonies
cement relations between the laity on the one hand and the religious consecrated persons
(the samgha) on the other. Morethanmerecommodities exchanged on the marketplace, gifts
contribute to the ranked order of the society. They reproduce the hierarchical links between

sustained by the search for merit and ultimate salvation. The indirectness of the transaction
is central. We are not faced with a chain of reciprocal gifts and counter-gifts, but with a
series of indirect prestations related to different kinds of things (tangible wealth versus
religious merit). Admittedly, there is less emphasis on elementary forms of reciprocity during
the Theravāda Kathina than at the Pañca Dāna ceremony. Yet, in both cases, gifts convey
the sign of a dense relationship between people and of close social interaction subsumed by ethic
values.
During Pañca and Kathina Dāna, the donor and the recipient of the gifts are dependent on
each other; they are not totally independent. These donations are therefore not reducible to
economics,tobarteringortomercantilepreoccupations.Thispointiscrucial.Imust,however,

ortea-house—anywhereinNepalandtoobservewhatactuallyhappenstherewouldconvince
any keen observerthat it is difficultto distinguish the two aspects. The price,for instance,and
the conditions for selling (possible credit, bargaining) one item vary greatly depending on
whether the client is a child, a relative, a member of the same ethnic group as the seller, a
foreigner, etc.
Thirdly,inbothcases,thespiritualidealsandtheethicsofnoblegiftshavebeenritualizedand
incorporated in cultic and festival practices within specific localities (Lewis 1993: 345). These
religiouspracticesareinkeepingwithotherlavish,spectacularNewarceremonies(Toffin2010).
Interestingly enough, Kathina Dāna events are called Kathina Dāna Mahotsav, ‘The great
festival of Kathina’. Even this Theravādin celebration has become a large communal event
organizedmanydaysbeforehandintheNewarstyle.Inotherwords,thesegift-givingceremo-
nies have over the ages become spectacular performances. During Kathina Dāna, meritorious
acts are highly publicized by monks as well as by the laity for the simple reason that: ‘In a
Buddhist society, donations foster more donations’ (Rozenberg 2004: 511). Displaying and
‘staging’ commendable acts are necessary to maintain devotees’ faith and to attract more
donations. This is not an exception. A similar theatricalization of Kathina occurs in Southeast
Asia(Tambiah1970:347).Moreoftenthannot,donationscallforpompandplay-acting.This
